An insect is a pollinating animal . earthworms create tunnels in soil . lizards eat insects . a stinger is used for defense by a wasp . a frog eats insects . some raccoons live in hollow logs . a salamander eats insects . runoff contains pesticides from cropland . incomplete metamorphosis is when an insect reaches the adult stage without being a pupa . volcanoes are often found under oceans . tunnels in soil loosen that soil . as the amount of fragrance of a flower increases , the number of pollinators it will attract increases . meadow voles eat insects . some crickets live in forests . soil loss causes grooves in soil . being burried under soil and mud changes peat into coal through extreme heat and pressure in a swamp over a long period of time . An example of camouflage is an organism looking like leaves . most chloroplasts are found in the leaves of a plant . a female insect lays eggs during the adult stage of an insect 's life cycle . as the size of a flower increases , the number of pollinators it will attract increases . as the size of an object appears larger , that object will be seen more easily . grass snakes live in grass . if an object reflects more light then that object is more easily seen . ink is used for hiding from predators by octopuses . if an object reflects light toward the eye then that object can be seen . octopuses releasing ink into the water causes predators to have difficulty seeing the octopus . the looseness of soil increases the amount of oxygen in that soil . In the tree reproduction process a squirrel has the role of seed disperser . as population of predators decreases , the population of prey will increase in an environment . insects can have a negative impact on crops . An example of hibernation is a frog burying itself in mud . pouring water onto soil causes that soil to wash away . a cavern is formed by carbonic acid in groundwater seeping through rock and dissolving limestone . a riverbank is made of soil . soil is formed by weathering . usually craters on planets are formed by asteroids impacting that planet or moon 's surface . if a hot substance is touches a cold object then that substance will likely cool . good bacteria grow on the skin . if a hot object is touches a cold substance then that substance will likely cool .
