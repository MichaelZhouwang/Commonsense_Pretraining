The Seneca evicted fifteen property owners from their homes for refusing to sign over their properties.
The increase in lease revenue from this reinterpretation has generated sufficient revenue for the nation to pay its enrolled members a quarterly social dividend, providing those members with a basic income.
In a similar case in 2012, the Seneca ordered an eviction of 80 residents of summer cottages at Snyder Beach on the Cattaraugus Reservation, a location near Sunset Bay.
They had previously notified the owner of the land that his leases to non-Seneca were not permissible, but he had done nothing to clear his property.
Some of the residents were from families who had rented there for decades.
The Seneca described the non-Natives as constituting a long-standing "illegal occupation".
The Seneca were the largest of the six Native American nations that comprised the Iroquois Confederacy or Six Nations.
Their democratic government pre-dated the United States Constitution.
In the Iroquois Confederacy, the Seneca were traditionally known as the "Keeper of the Western Door," for they are the westernmost of the Six Nations.
In the Seneca language the people are known as "O-non-dowa-gah," (pronounced: Oh-n'own-dough-wahgah) or "Great Hill People."
At the time of the formation of the Iroquois League, the original five nations of the Iroquois League occupied large areas of land in Northeast North America, particularly present-day New York and Pennsylvania, and Southeast Canada.
The historical Seneca occupied territory throughout the Finger Lakes area in Central New York, and in the Genesee Valley in Western New York, living in longhouses on the riversides.
The villages were well fortified with wooden-stake palisade fences.
These were settled communities in which the people cultivated staple crops known as the Three Sisters: varieties of corn, beans, and squash, which were known as "Deohako" (pronounced: Jo- hay- ko), "the life supporters."
Generally the women cultivated and processed the crops, maintaining seed crops and experimenting with varieties.
The Seneca were highly skilled at warfare, and were considered fierce adversaries by other Native Americans and European colonists.
But the Seneca were also renowned for their sophisticated skills at diplomacy and oratory, and their willingness to unite with the other four of the original Five Nations to form the Iroquois Confederacy of Nations.
Today the Seneca Nation sustains its own people.
Its enterprises benefit surrounding communities with a variety of cultural, educational and economic efforts.
Its varied enterprises include: world-class casino gaming, hospitality and entertainment, which employ over 3,500 people; a convenience store chain (four stores), construction management, and diverse holdings in business ventures.
The number of fluent Seneca language speakers is diminishing due to the deaths of elders, and the language is considered at-risk.
The Nation has established language programs to help protect, preserve and develop a new generation of Seneca-language speakers to keep the language alive.
Lacrosse is a sport played by male and female, young and old.
Two new community sports complexes on each territory enable year-round lacrosse leagues and space for community programs, crafts and learning.
Like other Iroquois tribes, Seneca Nation lacrosse players compete internationally on the Iroquois Nationals and Haudenosaunee Nationals squads, organized by the First Nations Lacrosse Association, which competes on par with fully sovereign nations such as the U.S. and Canada in international competition.
A Faithkeepers' School supports and ensures the ongoing practice of traditional teachings, arts, knowledge and the living culture of the Longhouse ways.
The vibrancy of the rich Seneca heritage is evident in the ceremonies, practices, and cultural events that are infused with dance, music and song, arts, crafts and traditional foods that honor and celebrate Seneca culture.
Lauren Engineers & Constructors is a North American Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contractor based in Abilene, Texas.
The company specializes in industrial and heavy construction projects in the power, polymers, chemicals, refining, and specialty metals markets in the U.S. and Canada.
Fabrication operations are located in Abilene, Texas and Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Lauren is licensed as a contractor in 39 states.
Founded in Atlanta, Georgia in 1984, Lauren Engineers & Constructors started as a small specialty non-union contractor and subsidiary of Comstock Mechanical.
In the 25-years since its founding, the company has become independent and privately owned while growing into a fully integrated provider of professional engineering and construction services.
The company’s development has occurred through both internal growth and corporate acquisitions, including companies such as Brock and Blevins (Chattanooga, TN), Commercial Welding Company (South Portland, ME), PCI Engineering (Houston, TX), Kamtech and Kamtech Services, and Tippett & Gee (Abilene, TX).
In 1994, Lauren relocated its headquarters from Atlanta, Georgia to Abilene, Texas, taking up residence in the historic Park Office Building built in 1922.
Three years later, the company’s fabrication shop was started in Abilene.
The company utilizes the fabrication shop to support Lauren’s EPC projects as well as performing third party work.
In 2007, Lauren doubled the size of the company’s headquarters by adding on to the existing building, matching the vintage exterior Neoclassical brick décor.
Lauren was the EPC contractor on the 64 MW Nevada Solar One parabolic trough project near Las Vegas, Nevada which was completed in 2007 after just 16 months of construction.
This was the first utility scale CSP project to be completed in the U.S. in 16 years.
Lauren's fabrication operations specialize in building custom process equipment skids, pipe rack modules, and prefabrication of pipe and vessels for the heavy industrial construction industry, serving both internal and external clients.
The original fabrication office and manufacturing facility is located on 40 acres at 550 South 18th Street in Abilene, Texas.
In 2015 Lauren expanded its fabrication capabilities with acquisition of a 126,000 square foot pipe and vessel welding facility at the Port of Catoosa in Tulsa, Oklahoma with access to the US Inland Waterway.
Faces in the Crowd by Leo Butler was first performed at the Royal Court theatre in London in 2008.
The original cast had Amanda Drew and Con O'Neill directed by Clare Lizzimore.
It has been called a 'credit-crunch generation Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'
It was one of the first pieces of theatre to examine the credit crunch and focused on an estranged husband and wife.
The original performance was particularly notable for the staging where the play was performed in the round and the audience sat above the flat in which the play was set and looked down on the action.
Dave and Joanna were married but he left their Sheffield flat under too much pressure.
The action starts 10 years later when Joanna comes to visit him wanting a baby, they fight and argue viciously and sleep together as secrets come out about their past.
Lyn Gardner of The Guardian described the play as "awash with alcohol, vitriol and violence" and "a Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
She also praised "the most full-frontally brave performances in London from Con O'Neill and Amanda Drew as the toxic ex-partners".
She went on to say that "there are times when it is so raw and bloody, you want to avert your gaze", but failed to be convinced by the play's political and economic dimensions when "Dave and Joanne stop beating the hell out of each other and start spouting social-history textbooks."
Fiona Mountford of the Evening Standard described it as "the nearest theatre has yet come to a credit crunch play", commenting that "Butler worries at some weighty themes in his spare script, covering not only our have-now-pay-later culture but also the failure of feminist rhetoric when countered with the brutal facts of female biology."
However, she was frustrated that Butler's "theoretical arguments are not pushed far enough", but congratulated it as "a thrillingly no-holds-barred production, powered by commendably raw performances from Drew and O’Neill."
Dominic Cavendish of The Daily Telegraph wrote that "Butler's outstanding new play - his best yet - catches the mood of the moment in its raw and devastating account of a couple who got swept along on a tide of easy credit, only to end up dashed against a northern rock of debt."
Praising the "intensely pitiful scene that can shift in the space of a phrase from the bleakly funny to the unbearably excruciating", the reviewer went on to say that "I can't think of a recent play that catches so acutely the way that, while it may be tough up North, it can be grim down South too.
And with incredible deftness, Butler ponders the harsh predicament of women who flounder when they hit the glass ceiling of reproductive reality.
This is a timely, savagely brilliant theatrical epitaph for the New Labour decade of shattered hopes and dreams turned sour."
The Toyota Camry (XV40) is a mid-size car that was produced by Toyota from January 2006 to July 2011.
Replacing the XV30 series, the XV40 represented the sixth generation of the Toyota Camry in all markets outside Japan, which followed a different generational lineage.
Between 2006 and 2010, a badged engineered model called Daihatsu Altis sold alongside the Camry in Japan.
Toyota replaced the XV40 series in 2011 with the XV50.
Introduced at the January 2006 North American International Auto Show, the XV40 made its North American sales debut in March 2006 as a 2007 model.
For the first time, a gasoline/electric hybrid version of Camry was offered in addition to the naturally aspirated four- and six-cylinder engines.
Like the previous XV30 model, the XV40 was offered in two distinct forms.
The Camry sold in Australasia and North America was the same as the version available in Japan; the version sold in China and the majority of Southeast Asia was based on the Australian-designed Toyota Aurion (XV40).
Like the previous XV30, the design of the XV40 series Toyota Camry was split into two separate configurations: "regular" and "prestige".
The "regular Camry" is sold in Australasia, Hong Kong, India, Japan, the Middle East, North America, and Russia.
However, the "prestige Camry" is an Australian-designed model sold alongside the "regular Camry" in Australasia and the Middle East as the Toyota Aurion.
China and most Southeast Asian countries also receive the Aurion, although it is badged "Toyota Camry" as the regular car is not offered those markets.
Making its debut at the January 2006 North American International Auto Show, the XV40 Camry takes a sleeker shape compared to its predecessor.
The design is based on Toyota's "vibrant clarity" corporate design language, with a three-bar grille and stepped hood and trunk.
Development began in early-2002 under the chief engineer Kenichiro Fuse.
A final design was set in September 2003 and frozen in August 2004, 17 months ahead of production.
Design patents were filed on 27 December 2005 at the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
The XV40 was redesigned to incorporate a longer wheelbase, wider wheel tracks, and a stiffer body.
Although overall length is equal to its predecessor, Toyota maximized interior volume—especially fore-and-aft space.
This was achieved by moving the base of the windshield and rear glass outwards and by the redesigning of the front seats.
At , cargo space has been reduced by over the previous model.
The SE/Sportivo provides due to the placement of bracing behind the rear seat, with the hybrid version falling to due to the placement of the battery pack.
The XV40's underbody is stepped, creating a venturi effect and hence a low-pressure area under the front end to increase downforce.
Other aerodynamic design features include a stepped engine undercover and rear wheel fairings to channel airflow around the tires.
The coefficient of drag figure remains at 0.28, falling to 0.27 for the hybrid version (which makes it the most aerodynamic car built in Australia).
The sports-oriented model, known as the "SE" in North America and "Sportivo" in Australasia, was developed by Toyota Australia.
It features a black "honeycomb" grille, black-tinted head and fog lamps, rear lip spoiler, body kit appendages, and a lower ride height coupled with wider and larger 17-inch diameter wheels.
To increase rear-end downforce, the SE/Sportivo includes additional rear floor and fuel tank undercovers.
Handling-specific upgrades see the use of firmer shock absorbers, a rise in spring rate, thicker anti-roll bars, additional floor and body side bracing, and a "V"-brace behind the rear seat (which prevents the rear seat from folding down, offering a ski-pass only).
Interior changes include charcoal-colored sports fabric and a leather-wrapped three-spoke steering wheel.
In addition to the sports-oriented suspension setup, Toyota Australia's standard-grade suspension calibration has also been adopted by New Zealand, the Middle East and North America.
The suspension geometry consists of independent MacPherson struts, L-arms, coil springs, gas dampers and a ball-jointed stabilizer bar at the front, with the rear setup comprising dual-link independent MacPherson struts with coil springs, gas dampers and ball-jointed stabilizer bar.
Toyota introduced a refreshed "regular" Camry XV40 design in January 2009 at the North American International Auto Show.
Visual changes include an updated front fascia, including grille and bumper with larger air intakes, larger projector headlamps, redesigned tail lamp lenses incorporating LEDs on all models (previously hybrids only), and revised wheel trims among other design changes.
The interior received revised trim, improved power window switches, and a revamped audio system.
The audio system now supports satellite radio (in North America) and added USB connectivity, with the dashboard-mounted screen now integrating a backup camera for models fitted with satellite navigation.
The Camry sold in the majority of Southeast Asia, China, and Taiwan is referred to as the "prestige Camry" by Toyota officials in Japan.
The prestige Camry is a rebadged Toyota Aurion (XV40), a regional product designed in Australia and based on the regular Camry.
Although front and rear fascias are unique to the Aurion, the body sides including doors and rear quarters, the greenhouse, and roof are interchangeable with the regular Camry.
This component sharing also means that Aurion has the same wheelbase, axle tracks, and interior dimensions.
From the inside, the Aurion also shares a common interior design with the Camry, including an almost identical lower dashboard, but gaining a redesigned upper dash portion and revamped center console.
In the Middle East, the Aurion shares the dashboard with the regular Camry.
Like the Camry, the Aurion was designed with Toyota's "vibrant clarity" design language.
However, the Aurion also integrates a "vibrant clarity" theory known as "perfect imbalance" that involves body features that act as a counterpoint to other body features.
Examples of this include intersecting concave and convex surfaces and vertical sculpted features on the front fascia, which are balanced by the horizontal headlamps.
The front-end's "double concave architecture" can also be characterized by its protruding hood crease line and deep grille.
The same architecture is applied at the rear, with a deep bumper, a clamshell-shaped trunk lid that envelops over the flanks, dual exhaust pipes and tail lamps.
Known as the "Toyota Camry Hybrid", the gasoline–electric model premiered in January 2006—alongside the non-hybrid car.
Camry Hybrids were initially built solely at the Tsutsumi plant in Toyota, Aichi, Japan, although the hybrid has never been available for purchase in its home market.
Since October 2006, models for the North American market shifted production to Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky in the United States.
Toyota Australia began local manufacture of the hybrid on 11 December 2009 at its Altona, Victoria plant.
In Australasia, the car is known as the "Toyota Hybrid Camry", as opposed to "Camry Hybrid".
Since May 2009, the hybrid model has also been produced at Toyota Motor Thailand's Gateway plant in Chachoengsao.
Unlike the Camry Hybrid models produced elsewhere, the Thai models are based on the "prestige Camry" design.
As of August 2009, worldwide sales of the Camry Hybrid represent 8.3 percent of Toyota's total hybrid sales, ranking second after the Toyota Prius, with more than 167,000 Camry Hybrids sold.
As of December 2009 cumulative sales of the Camry Hybrid had reached 154,977 units in the US, placing it as the third best selling electric hybrid car in that market.
Compared to the gasoline-only variants, several features are unique to the hybrid.
In addition to the hybrid powertrain, the Camry Hybrid employs electric power steering, brakes, and air conditioning that are fully operational once the internal combustion engine is deactivated.
The car can run in an all-electric mode, gasoline-only or both.
A real-time dashboard screen shows power distribution and the operation of the hybrid system and the tachometer is replaced by an analog fuel economy readout.
The hybrid drivetrain has also necessitated a redesigned front subframe, along with remodeled rear and center floor pressings.
This was required to accommodate the battery pack, which is stowed in the trunk.
Other differences include wheel spats and underbody pans which reduce aerodynamic drag from 0.28 to 0.27 "c", an "Eco" operating mode for the HVAC system that reduces the output of air conditioning to assist fuel economy, and Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM).
Cosmetic changes are limited to redesigned tail lights with LEDs, a chrome-lined grille, as opposed to the color-coded version on every other Camry trim, and hybrid-oriented emblems including "Hybrid" badging on the front fenders and a decklid-mounted "Hybrid Synergy Drive" logo.
For the facelifted version that debuted at the January 2009 North American International Auto Show, Toyota worked to better differentiate the styling of the hybrid away from the rest of the Camry range.
This was achieved by fitting a distinct front fascia with a large, central air dam, vertically slotted fog lamps, and a single-blade grille.
From the rear, the tail lamps abstain from the primarily red lens inserts fitted previously, to predominantly clear lenses, while the interior receives a newly designed fuel economy gauge.
The design registrations for the facelifted Camry Hybrid, noting changes made to the original were filed on 19 December 2008 at the US Patent and Trademark Office.
Powertrain options for the Camry XV40 comprised both four- and six-cylinder engines with manual and automatic transmissions.
For the Japanese market only, an all-wheel drive variant of the 2.4-liter engine was available, although a four-speed automatic was the sole transmission fitted.
All other XV40 series Camrys utilize front-wheel drive.
XV40s produced in the United States from January 2009 saw the 2.4-liter "2AZ-FE" powerplant replaced by the 2.5-liter "2AR-FE" engine and with it bringing new six-speed manual and automatic transmissions.
In some markets, the top-level powertrain combination was a 3.5-liter "2GR-FE" V6 engine paired exclusively to a six-speed automatic.
Toyota also offered a hybrid electric version of the 2.4-liter engine, designated "2AZ-FXE" that employs the Atkinson cycle to maximize fuel economy.
The hybrid utilizes Toyota's Hybrid Synergy Drive (HSD) system and makes use of Toyota's electronic continuously variable transmission (e-CVT)—a mechanism similar in function to a regular CVT.
The gasoline engine produces and of torque, with the 650-volt electric motor providing and .
Working in conjunction, both powerplants produce a total combined output of , however, due to the intricacy of quantifying a combined torque figure, Toyota has not provided one.
The battery pack utilized by the hybrid version is a trunk-mounted nickel-metal hydride unit, weighing in at about .
Approximately of hybrid hardware is fitted to the car in total.
However, Toyota claims this is negated by the increased output courtesy of the electric motor that improves acceleration by an estimated 15 percent over the non-hybrid 2.4-liter, five-speed automatic variant.
At the November 2008 LA Auto Show, Toyota unveiled a concept compressed natural gas (CNG)-powered hybrid electric version.
Toyota improved the Camry's safety by increasing the XV40's structural rigidity.
This has been achieved through the application of ultra high-tensile steel, which is hot stamped to the Camry's roof, A- and B-pillars, and rocker panels.
The structure of the front seat mounts were designed to transfer side collision impact loads across the car.
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) awarded the Camry sedan an overall rating of "good" in both frontal offset and side impact crash tests.
Both tests also receive the "good" rating in all 14 measured categories, and is also rated "good" in the roof strength test with a 5.31 strength-to-weight ratio withstanding a peak force of .
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) originally rated the XV40 the full five-star rating for the frontal driver, frontal passenger, side driver, and side rear passenger tests, and a four-star rating for the rollover test.
However, under the new NHTSA testing methodology introduced in 2010, the 2011 model year XV40 was downgraded to a three-star rating.
This overall vehicle score was broken down into the frontal barrier crash rating of four-stars for the driver (male), and two-stars for the front passenger (female), giving an overall front-impact protection rating of three-stars.
A side barrier rating of five-stars for the driver (male), and two-stars for the front passenger (female), gave for an overall side-impact protection rating of three-stars.
The third testing component, the rollover rating, resulted in a grading of four-stars.
Subsequently, the NHTSA tested a later release of the 2011 model year Camry with enhanced safety.
This resulted in an increase to the side barrier rating from two- to four-stars for the front female passenger, thus increasing the Camry's overall score to four-stars.
Testing conducted by the Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) resulted in the Camry XV40 receiving a four-star safety rating or a score of 27.53 out of 37.
Dual frontal airbags were fitted to the model tested.
ANCAP later tested the hybrid variant fitted with additional side and curtain airbags.
The hybrid also scored four-stars, although did achieve a higher 28.22-point grading.
Prompted by the five-star ANCAP safety rating mandate for all passenger cars purchased by the Australian federal government from 1 July 2011, Toyota Australia revised the XV40 specification including the fitment of a front passenger seatbelt reminder.
This resulted in an upgraded five-star result for Australian models produced from May 2011.
While the regular version scored 33.13 points, the hybrid rated marginally better at 33.22 out of 37.
The offset crash yielded 14.29 out of 16, with 14.84 out of 16 for the side impact crash test.
An additional two points came from completing the pole test, while the seatbelt reminders yielded the qualifying two points required for the five-star result.
The hybrid fared identically except in the offset crash test where it gained 0.08 points then picking up 0.01 in the side impact crash.
Both cars also scored a "marginal" pedestrian protection rating at 14.5 out of 36.
The 2010 edition of Monash University's "Used Car Safety Ratings", found that the XV40 provides an "excellent" (five out of five stars) level of occupant safety protection in the event of an accident.
On 26 September 2007, Toyota recalled the optional "all-weather" heavy-duty rubber floor mats from 2007 and 2008 model year Toyota Camry XV40s sold in North America.
Toyota issued a second recall on 2 November 2009 asking owners to remove the driver floor mat and not replace it with any other type of mat.
Toyota extended its floor mat recall on 25 November to reconfigure the accelerator pedal, replace the all-weather floor mats, and install a brake override system to prevent sudden unintended acceleration.
Toyota issued a fourth unwanted acceleration-related recall for the Camry on 21 January 2010, this time in response to reports of accelerator pedals sticking in models without floor mats.
Evaluations by "Car and Driver" and Edmunds found that the Camry's brakes were powerful enough to overcome the accelerator in all tests, bringing the car safely to a stop.
Toyota Camry XV40s were produced at the Tsutsumi Plant in Toyota, Aichi, Japan; the Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky production site at Georgetown, Kentucky in the United States; Toyota Australia's facility in Altona, Victoria; and Shushary, Saint Petersburg, Russia from December 2007.
On 20 April 2007, additional US Camry manufacturing began at Subaru of Indiana Automotive in Lafayette, Indiana.
A Camry manufactured in Japan is denoted with a Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) starting with "J"; US-made models are denoted with a numeral.
The Camry in Japan was released on 30 January 2006 with a sales target of 1,000 units per month.
Two driveline combinations are offered—the 2.4-liter engine and five-speed automatic transmission in front-wheel drive (FWD) configuration—or the same engine paired with the four-speed automatic utilizing all-wheel drive (AWD).
Offered in three levels of luxury: "G", "G Limited Edition", and "G Dignis Edition", AWD is optional on the two base trims ("G Four" and "G Four Limited Edition").
The base-line Camry "G" features 16-inch steel wheels, six airbags, keyless entry and start, "Optitron" gauges, speed-sensitive automatic door locks, a four-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift lever, a wood grain center console, dual-zone climate control air conditioning, and an electric driver's seat (FWD only).
The second level "G Limited Edition" gains 16-inch alloy wheels and cruise control, while the top-level "G Dignis Edition" features a metallic-finished grille insert, Vehicle Stability Control (VSC), rain-sensing windscreen wipers, wood grain inserts for the steering wheel and shift knob, and a widescreen touch LCD (incorporating satellite navigation, television, Bluetooth handsfree support, and G-BOOK telematics).
Daihatsu continued with its Altis variant for the Japanese market, also introduced on 30 January 2006.
Offered in "G Limited Edition" (FWD) and "G Four Limited Edition" (AWD) specification levels, the Altis roughly correlates with the Camry equivalents.
Visually, the Altis is identical to the Japanese market Camry, with only the badging unique to the Daihatsu.
The wood grain interior trim of the Camry/Altis changed from yellow-brown to red-brown during a small update in July 2007, with VSC made standard fitment when the facelift version commenced sales on 13 January 2009.
Toyota ceased manufacture of the Daihatsu-branded models in February 2010 due to low sales; just 447 units of the XV40 series Altis were registered in three years.
The base "W1" is fitted with the 2.4-liter gasoline engine and five-speed manual transmission.
It is fitted with dual-zone climate control air conditioning, a six-CD player, power front seats, rain-sensing wipers, six airbags, and high-intensity discharge (HID) headlamps.
Upgrades to the "W2" grade include: a five-speed automatic transmission, cruise control, rear HVAC vents, and Vehicle Stability Control (VSC).
The "W3" and "W4" versions are specified identically to the "W1" and "W2", respectively, other than for the addition of a sunroof.
In the Middle East, the Camry range is sourced from Toyota Australia and is only available with the 2.4-liter engine, with the option of both manual and automatic transmissions.
Three levels of trim are offered: "GL", "GLX", and "SE".
The Australian-market version of the XV40 Camry made its media debut on 25 July 2006.
Produced at the Toyota Australia plant in Altona, Victoria, Australian-manufactured XV40s were also exported to New Zealand and the Pacific Islands, although the majority of exports went to the Middle East.
As of 2008, the Camry was the best selling Australian-produced vehicle, when taking into account all sales, both domestic and exports.
For the first time since 1988, the Camry was marketed in Australasia with a four-cylinder engine only.
This decision was made as the Toyota Aurion—a model which derives from the Camry—was offered in V6 configuration only.
This two-tier strategy went against Toyota Australia's previous formula of offering four- and six-cylinder engines in the mid-size Camry alongside the larger six-cylinder Avalon.
The simplified Australian Camry range comprised "Altise", "Sportivo", "Ateva", and "Grande".
The model range in New Zealand followed this closely, offered in three levels of specification: "GL" (Altise), "Sportivo" and "GLX" (Grande).
Equipments levels correspond directly with the Australian cars, although the full suite of airbags were fitted as standard on the "GL".
Equipment levels for the base model "Altise" comprised (at launch) air conditioning, cruise control, power windows and mirrors, 16-inch steel wheels, and a single-disc CD player.
The "Sportivo" grade added 17-inch alloy wheels, a body kit, front fog lamps, bolstered electrically adjustable front seats, leather-bound steering wheel, gear and handbrake levers, side and curtain airbags, and an in-dash six-CD player.
Building on the "Altise" specification, the "Ateva" gained 16-inch alloy wheels, a chrome grille surround, fog lamps, dual zone climate control air conditioning, side and curtain airbags, a six-stack CD audio system, power-adjustable front seats, automatic headlamps, trip computer and a leather-wrapped steering wheel, gear and handbrake levers.
Furthering this, the "Grande" specification incorporates leather upholstery, wood grain inserts, satellite navigation, Vehicle Stability Control (VSC), Bluetooth connectivity, rain-sensing windscreen wipers, a sunroof and an electrically operated rear window blind.
In May 2008, the Grande variant received a change in specification to the same set of alloy wheels as the "Sportivo" variant, as opposed to the previous style shared with the "Ateva" grade.
Toyota released the "Ateva L" at the same time as this running change.
The limited edition "Ateva L" added a rear lip spoiler, "Sportivo" alloy wheels, and leather trim.
A second limited edition XV40, the "Touring" was launched in April 2009 based on and priced identically to the automatic transmission-equipped "Altise".
The "Touring" added 17-inch alloy wheels, the "Sportivo" grille, a chrome exhaust outlet, front fog lamps, a six-disc CD changer, dual zone climate control air conditioning, and a leather steering wheel, handbrake and gear selection lever.
Further equipment upgrades arrived on 20 July 2009 when the facelifted Australian range went on sale.
All variants now offered six airbags, Bluetooth, an auxiliary audio-input jack for the sound system, sun visor lamps and seatback pockets.
The "Ateva" grade received a new audio system with 4.3-inch color LCD incorporating a rear-view camera, while the "Sportivo" variant gained the same LCD and dual-zone climate control.
Upgrades for the "Grande" comprised keyless entry and starting system, rear parking sensors, an electrochromatic rear-view mirror, backup camera, and an upgraded sound system.
The limited edition "Touring" was re-launched the following June, this time adding a reversing camera, a rear lip spoiler, and manual transmission availability over the previous release.
Due to lack of demand, Australian manufacture of Camrys fitted with manual transmissions ended at the end of May 2011.
As part of the Australian Government's "Green Car Innovation Fund", Toyota received a 35 million grant in June 2008 to guarantee the commencement of local production of the hybrid powertrain Camry.
Prior to release, Toyota Australia displayed an official concept model, the "HC-CV" (Hybrid Camry Concept Vehicle) at the 2009 Melbourne International Motor Show.
The "HC-CV" is distinguished from the facelifted Hybrid Camry design from which it is based by the inclusion of a modified front-end fascia, redesigned wheels and side skirts, a custom rear spoiler, and leather upholstery incorporating the "Hybrid Synergy Drive" logo.
Full-scale production began on 11 December 2009, after a small batch of pre-production vehicles were produced from 31 August.
Toyota released the Hybrid Camry for sales in Australia during February 2010, with plans to sell an estimated 10,000 units per year.
After its release, the Hybrid Camry became the first Australian-built vehicle to be rated the top five star grading on the Australian Government's "Green Vehicle Guide".
The hybrid model is offered in two levels of trim, equivalent to the mid-range "Ateva" and luxury "Grande" gasoline-only variants.
The undesignated entry-level specification is equipped identically to the "Ateva", except for the omission of electric front seats and the addition of reversing sensors, keyless entry/start, and VDIM.
An option pack sees the addition of a premium eight-speaker sound system, Bluetooth connectivity, and satellite navigation.
The second-level Hybrid Camry "Luxury" acquires leather interior trim, power-adjustable front seats, rain-sensing wipers, an electro-chromatic rear-view mirror and a rear lip spoiler.
An option pack for the "Luxury" includes equipment of the aforementioned "base" option pack, plus a sunroof and interior lighting upgrades for rear passengers.
Toyota began producing the Camry at its Russian facility in December 2007.
In North America, the 2007 model year XV40 series Camry came with a standard 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine or optional 3.5-liter V6.
The 2.4-liter comes standard with a five-speed manual transmission; a five-speed automatic was optional on the "CE" and "SE" trims, standard on "LE" and "XLE".
After the 2008 model year, Toyota dropped the "CE" identifier from the base-line offering.
Safety-wise, all XV40s in the United States and Canada came factory-equipped with dual frontal airbags, front seat-mounted side torso airbags, front and rear row side curtain airbags, and a driver's knee airbag.
In the United States, Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) was optional on all models (except for the hybrid, where VDIM was standard) for the 2007 through to 2009 model years, but was standardized for 2009.
Canadian specification 2007 and 2008 models had VSC standard on the V6-engined "SE" and "XLE" trims, optional on the "LE" V6, with VDIM again reserved for the hybrid.
Toyota Canada extended VSC to all models during the 2009 model year, except the base "LE" four-cylinder model, where it was available as part of the "Convenience Package".
The 2010 facelifted models, sold in Canada from April 2009, have VSC standard.
On the entry level "CE", features included: 16-inch wheels, air conditioning, power windows and mirrors, cruise control, and a six-speaker audio system with CD player and auxiliary input.
Keyless entry and an eight-way power driver seat were added to the "LE" trim, with the "SE" gaining a firmer suspension tune, 17-inch alloy wheels, blue-tinged "Optitron" gauge illumination, and sports-oriented interior and exterior trim modifications.
The top-level "XLE" builds on the "LE" specification, with a six-CD JBL sound system rated at 440-watts, with integrated Bluetooth technology.
Other "XLE" upgrades comprise a sunroof, automatic dual-zone climate control air conditioning with air filter, satellite navigation, wood grain highlights, and reclining rear seats.
On four-cylinder "XLE" models, the interior textile is coated using silkworm cocoon extract, while heated front seats and full leather upholstery are standard on the "XLE" fitted with the V6.
The updated 2010 model also has an optional limited-slip differential and TRD-tuned exhaust system on SE trim.
Features include an optional ion air purifier type filtration system.
The new 2.5-liter straight-4 engines replace the previous 2.4-liter four-cylinder in non-hybrid models.
Sales in the United States, the primary market for the Camry, significantly increased in the year following release.
In April 2007, Toyota began producing additional Camry models at Subaru of Indiana Automotive in Lafayette, Indiana.
In a Cars.com American-Made Index study, the Camry was ranked highest, all models sold in the US are assembled there.
"Consumer Reports" 2007 Annual Car Reliability Survey gave the V6 version of the Camry a "below average" rating, due to transmission issues thus removing the V6 Camry from Consumer Reports' "Recommended" list.
This rating does not apply to the four-cylinder and hybrid versions, which continued to be recommended.
However, these problems have been corrected, and the V6 version has improved to "average".
The first three model years of this generation Camry were also plagued by excessive oil consumption issues.
Many owners claimed their engines would lose over one quart of oil in as little as 1,000 miles.
Toyota later did a warranty enhancement program to correct this issue free of charge to customers.
Toyota also offered full refunds to owners who previously paid for repairs, even before if the repairs were performed before the warranty enhancement program.
To commemorate 50 years of Toyota sales in the United States, Toyota built a special edition 2007 Camry Hybrid.
The 50th Anniversary Edition was limited to 3,000 units and features unique wheels and badging, and is painted exclusively in the "Blizzard Pearl" color.
The Hybrid Camry has also received two awards in North America: the 2007 Green Car of the Year awarded by Green Car Journal, and the 2007 Car of the Year in the Family Sedan (over ) category awarded by the Automobile Journalists Association of Canada.
When released, the EPA rated the hybrid about 27 percent more economical on the combined cycle compared to the non-hybrid 2.4-liter automatic version.
EPA's revised method of estimating fuel economy for 2008 and subsequent model years, which now considers the effects of air conditioning, rapid acceleration and cold temperatures, estimates (city) and (highway).
The California Air Resources Board (CARB) has certified the Camry Hybrid as AT-PZEV, while the EPA has assigned it a Tier II, Bin 3 score for most states a cleaner version is sold to CARB states.
The hybrid also meets the US Super Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (SULEV) standards which means it produces minimal emissions of hydrocarbons, nitrous oxides and carbon monoxide, and up to year model 2010 it had an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) "Greenhouse Gas Score" of 9.5 for California and 8.0 for federal certified vehicles.
In North America, the Camry Hybrid has benefited from several government incentives relating to taxation and special provisions in carpool lanes (see: hybrid tax credit and government incentives for fuel efficient vehicles in the United States for more information).
This generation was entered into stock car racing in the United States in 2007 as part of Toyota's entry into NASCAR.
The move made the XV40 Camry the first foreign vehicle in the NASCAR circuit since the British-built MG MGA was used in the Grand National Series in 1963.
The succeeding XV50 generation would continue participation of the Toyota Camry in NASCAR.
Hills Supermarkets, owned by H. Frederick Hill, was a New York based grocery store chain which was popular in the 1960s.
In May 1977 it was sold as a subdivision of Pueblo International Inc., to Food Fair.
In March 1955 Hills Supermarkets leased in the Pine Oaks Shopping Center at Boundary Avenue in North Massapequa, New York.
The following month Hills signed a fifteen-year lease for a store to be located at the Hub Shopping Center, approximately one mile north of Amityville, New York.
In October 1961 Hills operated 23 stores with plans to open 7 more and expand an 8th within the next twelve months.
Each planned store was to be except for one.
a store in the Walt Whitman Shopping Center in Huntington, New York, which measured 29,000 square feet.
In the two years prior to November 1976, Pueblo International, Inc., had closed 29 Hills stores as well as a distribution center in Brentwood, New York.
The indebted 43 units of Hills Supermarkets sold for a sum of approximately $7 million in 1977, to Food Fair.
Food Fair filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in October 1978, and 42 Hills locations were closed shortly thereafter.
Santa Barbara was a station on the Port Authority of Allegheny County's light rail network, located in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania.
The street level stop was designed as a small commuter stop, serving area residents who walked to the train so they could be taken toward Downtown Pittsburgh.
Santa Barbara was one of eleven stops closed on June 25, 2012 as part of a system-wide consolidation effort.
Citizen Jane is a 1999 true crime non-fiction book by James Dalessandro about the real-life efforts of a woman to track down the con artist who murdered her aunt.
In 2009, the book was adapted into a Hallmark Channel film starring Ally Sheedy, Meat Loaf, Sean Patrick Flanery, and Nia Peeples.
Jane Alexander was a sheltered, attractive widow living with her large, close-knit family in her small hometown of Truckee, California.
For six years, she had been living with Tom O'Donnell, her charismatic and handsome boyfriend.
He had used wit, charm, and tales of adventure to borrow money for extensive home business operations and investing.
When Gertrude McCabe, her favorite 88-year-old aunt, was gruesomely murdered in San Jose in 1983, a case which baffled San Jose PD.
A break came from newly assigned police detective Jack Morris, whose investigative genius would soon solve the case.
It was a difficult case to crack, but the motive was clearly something personal.
McCabe was bludgeoned, choked with a bicycle lock, stabbed over two dozen times in her neck and back with a knife.
Morris soon convinced Alexander that the killer was her boyfriend, and after O'Donnell disappeaed with over $10,000 of her money and left her near bankruptcy, Alexander embarked on an epic journey to track down and outsmart the wily con artist.
After 13 years of collecting evidence, Alexander and Morris managed to convict O'Donnell of first degree murder.
Police believe O'Donnell killed Gertrude McCabe because she would inherit her Aunt Gertrude's estate.
O'Donnell was sentenced to life imprisonment; he died in 2010.
James Dalessandro first read about Jane Alexander's story in the mid-1990s on the front page of the "Pacific Sun" in Marin County, California.
Much of the research comes from detailed diaries that Alexander kept of the entire ordeal.
David Mehnert contributed to the book after being in a private screenwriting class taught by Dalessandro.
Alexander, a grandmother of 12 at the time, actively contributed to Dalessandro's writing process.
She also founded the organization Citizens Against Homicide to help others solve the murders of their loved ones.
In 2006 she received the prestigious Minerva Award for her efforts.
She died on December 14, 2008, at the age of 86.
At the time of her death, she was working on 500 open homicide cases and had helped solve more than 20 cold case murders, along with the help of Jan Miller, whose daughter Veronica was the victim of a still unsolved homicide.
Curryville was platted in 1859.
A post office was established at Curryville in 1879, and remained in operation until it was discontinued in 1907.
Curryville is located at the intersection of 700 W. (800 W. in Wells County) and 300 N. in both counties, at .
Batman: The Lazarus Syndrome is a 1989 BBC Radio 4 broadcast, produced to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the popular comic book character Batman.
The story was originally written by Simon Bullivant and Dirk Maggs.
It contains references to such Batman stories as "", "", "", and "".
Michael Gough, who provides the voice of Alfred Pennyworth, also played the same role on screen in the films "Batman", "Batman Returns", "Batman Forever" and "Batman & Robin".
On the anniversary of his parents' murder, Batman visits the location of their deaths and is set upon by an old enemy, who has had surgery to look like Bruce Wayne.

With the disappearance of the Batman, Commissioner Gordon begins searching for any lead, even going as far as arranging meetings with The Joker and Catwoman.
Meanwhile, in Wayne Manor, Bruce Wayne informs Alfred and Nightwing that he is retiring from vigilantism.
But at the same time the true Batman awakens in the custody of Talia al'Ghul and must regain his strength and awareness before this impostor uses Wayne Enterprises to bring ruin to the world.
The events of this story are set after "" and "", but before Tim Drake is introduced.
He was born in Bethayres, Pennsylvania, the son of Joseph Wharton Lippincott and Elizabeth Schuyler Mills Lippincott.
Mr. Lippincott went to the Meadowbrook School and then to St. Paul's School before attending Princeton University.
In 1937 he joined the family firm he would serve for 41 years.
During his years as president, Mr. Lippincott oversaw the rapid expansion of the company in the 1950s and 1960s, the transformation of Lippincott into a public company in 1972, and its eventual acquisition by Harper & Row (now called “HarperCollins”) in 1978.
Many of J. B. Lippincott Company's well-known elementary and high school educational products were launched during his presidency, including Basic Keys to Spelling, Lippincott's Basic Reading, and Beginning to Read, Write and Listen.
Mr. Lippincott was also responsible for expanding the company’s business outside of the United States, and made frequent trips to Europe and across the Pacific to Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines.
Mr. Lippincott was an active supporter of libraries, serving on the boards of Trustees of the Free Library of Philadelphia and of the Ludington Library in Bryn Mawr.
He regularly attended the annual meeting of the American Library Association (ALA) to present the Joseph W. Lippincott Award for Outstanding Achievement in Librarianship, which was named for and founded by his father in 1938.
It is one of the oldest and most prestigious awards given by the ALA.
He married Marie Louise Beck in 1950.
He died in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.
Manuel dos Santos Junior (born February 22, 1939) is a former Brazilian swimmer, former world record holder and a bronze medalist in 100-metre freestyle at the Olympic Games in Rome in 1960.
At 4 years of age, Manoel spent months in a hospital, recovering from recurrent threats of pneumonia and similar diseases, that his body suffered.
His father saw in swimming the salvation of that drama.
Before completing eleven years old, in early 1950, Manoel was studying in Rio Claro, in the Gymnasium Koelle, a German college.
The boy found himself away from his family, which he saw only on holidays and "holy week", when he took the train to the western state.
There in Rio Claro, the rigid routine of the college, Manoel fits well with the swimming program.
In a 20-meter pool, under the guidance of Bruno Buch, his first master, he began to train, compete and make the team gym.
The strongest swimmer of the group was a boy three years older than Manoel, named João Gonçalves Filho, future champion and South American record holder in the backstroke and an athlete in various sports, who participated in various Olympic Games.
In 1955, Manoel dos Santos approached the national top.
He swam backstroke, and his training was more focused in this style.
The top three sprinters in the country at the turn of the decade and early '50s (Aram Boghossian, Sérgio Rodrigues and Plauto Guimarães) had retired.
Lara was the best swimmer in the country until 1957, when he retired, moved to Italy and became an opera singer.
In March 1955, at age 16, Manoel was summoned to his first international competition, the II Pan American Games in Mexico City.
In Mexico, after a trip into a military aircraft, a DC-3, which lasted four days, with overnight in Belém, Trinidad and Tobago and Cuba, Manoel competed very poorly.
His main memory of the tournament was the moment he left desolate of proof, fell on a nearby heating pool and pretending to be loosening up, cried a lot, solitude, until the last tear is lost hidden in the middle of chlorine.
At the 1955 Pan American Games in Mexico City, he finished 4th in the 4 × 100-metre medley.
At the previous twelve, Brazil defeated Argentina only once, in the same Viña del Mar, in 1941.
Manoel dos Santos ranked fifth in the final of the 100-metre freestyle, and Haroldo Lara took the fourth position.
In the 200-metre backstroke, Manoel was fourth and the race was won by his compatriot João Gonçalves.
A tenth of a second ago, silver medalist, arrived Brazil.
The Argentines came in third, nine-tenths of a second behind Brazil.
The Brazilian relay team had Haroldo Lara, Manuel dos Santos, João Gonçalves and Aristarco de Oliveira.
He stated that, at that moment, he realized that his specialty and future were the 100-metre freestyle, and the backstroke was just a byproduct.
This flare, this awareness of where his true talent lay resulted in a short time, a leap of improvement.
As for the South American, as expected, porteños took the title again.
In November 1956, at the new pool of CR Vasco da Gama, Manoel dos Santos failed to get Olympic qualification, by two tenths of a second.
In 1957, finishing the secondary school in Rio Claro, Manoel dos Santos moved to Santos, São Paulo.
Hirano entered to swimming by the paths of the translation service, carried out during the stay of the "Flying Fish" in Brazil in 1950.
Hirano got much swimming knowledge, monitoring and deciphering the Japanese Olympians and world record holders.
In the late 50s, the footage of the training, even in Brazil, began to increase substantially.
He did Manoel swim a thousand meters and then working leg, positioning stroke, angle etc. chin, and finished with a half dozen shots of 25m.
Often he could not attend the training, and Manoel came alone to the session with a little paper in hand, or the sequence decorated into his head.
In December 1957, Manoel broke the Brazilian record of Haroldo Lara, and the South American record of Argentine Pedro Galvao in Santos, on 25 meter pool (still valid in that year), with a time of 56.5.
Further, in February 1958, was held the South American Championships in Montevideo.
For the first time in the history of the tournament, the winner of the 100-metre freestyle won the race handily, not in the beat of hand, but two and a half seconds ahead of, or fifteen feet away - Manoel dos Santos.
The only Brazilian besides Armando Freitas in 1939, to win the gold.
The silver medal went to nearly invincible Ismael Martínez Merino, Peruvian three times champion in 52, 54 and 56.
The Manoel's time in qualifying, 56.6, represented new South American record, as from 1958, all international federations officiated the rule of consider valid only records obtained in 50 meter pool.
The following year, came the first trip to the United States.
The beds in the Olympic village assembled at the University of Chicago, were those of American soft mattress, strange and uncomfortable for someone who grew up sleeping on a hard bed of boarding school.
The body aching, and barely slept, and back that do not reared more, affected the balance of swimming.
Manoel dos Santos, the great hope of the Brazilian Swimming to win a medal at the Pan American Games in 1959, got only a fourth place in the 100-metre freestyle, swimming above the 58s, when expectations revolved around the 56s.
After Mexico 55 and Chicago 59, Manoel not arrive until São Paulo 63.
At the 1959 Pan American Games, in Chicago, he finished 4th in the 100-metre freestyle.
In February 1960, Santos went to the South American Championship in Cali, Colombia.
But Manoel dos Santos fulfilled its role fairly, taking the gold in the 100m freestyle and leading the Brazilian relays to win two golds and a silver.
In the end, Brazil won the first championship in history.
In 1960, Manoel dos Santos was swimmer of the Pinheiros.
But he continued to follow the guidelines determined by your Hirano technician, from Santos.
He used the Pinheiros pool, and sometimes the Corinthians pool, during the summer and in the winter, down the hill and gave their strokes in the Clube de Regatas Internacional.
In July 60, during the pre-Olympic final preparations, in Rio de Janeiro, Manoel convincingly broke his South American record of the 100-metre freestyle, with a time of 55.6.
This achievement has positioned him as a strong competitor to the Olympic medal in Rome.
Manuel, who started to swim for health problems, was the first Brazilian to get an Olympic medal in the sport in the 1960 Games.
In August, the Brazilian swimming team left for Europe.
Or rather, with political sense, determined by the military leadership in the Brazilian Olympic sports, typical of those times.
In Lisbon, a pool with water at 13 degrees temperature, Brazilian swimmers competed against a much weaker team than theirs, the selection of Portugal.
The result was a tonsillitis in the biggest star of Brazil, the only Brazilian swimmer until then to go to Olympics with real chances of escaping anonymity.
Manoel followed Lisbon, under antibiotic effect, landed and went to the Olympic village to soak for another day, away from the pool.
Then would be three more days to recover before the qualifiers of the 100-metre freestyle, the traditional opening race of the Olympic program at that time.
In Rome, the aquatic stadium was impressive, but the tables used to massage were still the traditional table tennis tables.
On Friday, August 29, 1960, at 8:30 am, began the swimming with the heats of the men's 100-metre free.
Manoel dos Santos, swimming in lane 4, won the third series, with a time of 56.3.
Twenty-four swimmers passed into the semis.
At night, in the semis, Manoel again won, tied in the same third grade in the same lane 4, with the same time 56.3.
Overall, now, he ranked fourth draw.
To qualify for the final was necessary 56.5, the Canadian Richard Pound's time, who, many years later, was to become famous as the sheriff of WADA, the world anti-doping agency.
Manoel dos Santos was cast in the lap 6.
He knew that would only have a chance if swam a second faster than the day before.
Was given the starting gun, the plateau output of those days, and were almost 40 meters without breathing.
When common sense screamed and he turned to right for the first pull of air, Manoel saw no one.
A few more strokes until Manoel locate the position of the opponents.
Meanwhile, much has happened on his head, including the ability to have escaped, size fright that he took.
In the crucial seconds of preparation for the turn, turn this more complicated in 1960, due to the requirement of hand touch before somersault and nonexistent glasses, Manuel was somewhat lost and was only find when hit unexpectedly, your forearm on the edge of the pool.
Who was there saw Manoel hit right in front in the 50-meter, turn of bumbling way, and came back behind the other competitors.
In the line of 80 meters, Manoel had regained the lead.
And there it came time to pay the price of unpredictable.
Although he maintained that died in the 20 meters remaining, the final difference was two tenths of a second.
The gold involved one of the most troubled decisions in the history of Olympic swimming.
Back in Brazil, Manoel entered the typical period of post-Olympics relaxation.
Lost some shape.
The warning came in an unexpected defeat in Brazil.
In unlucky pool of Vasco da Gama, the Brazilian Championship, in early 1961, Manoel took silver in the 100-metre freestyle, with a time of 57.8.
The training again intensify.
Manoel was invited to attend a series of international competitions of high level, first in Japan, then accidentally in the United States.
Those years were the last in which Japan's reputation in swimming even annually brought the most talented international guests, especially Americans, to participate in the Japanese national championship and other display competitions during the Japanese summer.
This tradition came from the 30s, when Japanese and Americans completely dominated the swimming scene.
After a bureaucratic and political exercise with the Brazilian sports directors, which would have its price charged in due time, Manoel went to Japan bringing Hirano.
There, he and the Argentine Luis Nicolao, the other guest, joined the American team representing the World "cream of the cream", and left for a tour of three competitions in the Nipponese islands.
As often happens with Brazilian and Hispanic abroad, one saw the other the illusion of being bilingual, when in fact the communication occurs through a third "language", a dragged portunhol.
But what no one knew was that there, between the two young Latinos, a little lost in the east and in the shadow of the American and Japanese famous swimmers, was kept hidden half of world speed records in swimming, soon to be revealed to the whole world inside the pool of Guanabara.
In Tokyo, at the Japanese Championship, he took first in the qualifiers, semis and final, with the times of 55.1, 55.2 and 55.3, respectively.
The 55.1 represented a new South American record.
In those days, the approval of records took weeks, and often, they were broken before formalized.
It happened in Japan because Manoel also took gold in competitions in Nagoya and Osaka, and in the latter he lowered the South American record another tenth, driven to 55.
The trip to Japan has Manoel well recognized among American swimmers and technical and specialized sports press.
Indeed, some people have come to provide a world record if Manoel improve his only weakness, the complicated Olympic turn of those times.
Returning from Japan, by Los Angeles route, Manoel decided to go to Hawaii.
Several days later, Manuel, tanned, relaxed and untrained, landed in Los Angeles.
Given his recent fame acquired then, he was invited to participate in the American championship in that city and accepted.
On August 18, 1961, Steve Clark, successively defeated by Manoel in Japan, won the final of the 100-metre freestyle, in the bustling crowd.
His 54.4 time beat the previous world record of 54.6, from Australian John Devitt, since January 1957.
Manoel was not at all bad, but ranked fourth, swimming over 55s.
Even in the pool, he was photographed shaking Clark, and appeared in the edition of the Swimming World Magazine September 1961.
Manoel categorically stated that on returning to Brazil he would beat that world record.
Clark listened and did not dare to doubt, as would reveal in the future.
The Brazilian was for some time too near the top of the world, not to believe that this would be possible.
On September 21, 1961, in Rio de Janeiro, alone in the swimming pool of Club de Regatas Guanabara, dos Santos set a new world record for the 100-metre freestyle with a time of 53.6 seconds.
The Company was formed in 1903, out of the merger of "George Trollope & Sons" (founded by Joseph Trollope, a wallpaper hanger, in 1778) and "Colls & Sons" (founded by Benjamin Colls, a painter and decorator, in 1840).
The merged firm started to specialise in civil engineering and during World War I undertook pioneering work on reinforced concrete.
In 1969 the Company was acquired by Trafalgar House.
On 18 April 1996 Norwegian shipbuilding and engineering group Kvaerner acquired "Trafalgar House Construction", as the business became known, as part of a £904 million offer for Trafalgar House plc.
Projects undertaken by the Company included: the Institute of Chartered Accountants completed in 1892, Claridges completed in 1897, the Baltic Exchange completed in 1903, Lloyds Bank in Lombard Street completed in 1931, Trawsfynndd power station completed in 1962 and the Stock Exchange Tower completed in 1972.
He was born in either 1861 or 1863 in Chicago, Illinois.
Attending the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Symons also studied in Europe and won awards at the National Academy of Design and the Corcoran Gallery of Art.
Symons was one of the plein-air painters who built their studios in Laguna Beach, California during the early 1900s.
He died in Hillside, New Jersey in 1930.
Patrick Sharp (died 1615) was a Scottish theologian and Principal of the University of Glasgow.
Soon after 1575 he was appointed one of a commission of classical scholars to draw up a new Latin grammar for use in the Scottish schools.
In 1585 James VI appointed him Principal of the University of Glasgow.
From this time he took an important part in the government and controversies of the Scottish church, He seems to have wished to preserve a position of neutrality between the two parties which divided the kirk, but he gradually inclined to the king's party.
In 1586 he was placed on a commission charged by the general assembly to control the proceedings of the bishops.
In 1596 the general assembly appointed him and fifteen others to organise the church in opposition to the government.
Consequently, he was ordered by the privy council to return to Glasgow.
But in the same year he took part in the reactionary general assembly at Perth, and in 1597 he formed part of the commission to whom were delegated the powers of the general assembly when that body was not in session, and whose appointment paved the way for the re-establishment of episcopacy.
In 1606 Sharp was summoned to Hampton Court with seven other divines, to support the king's side in a debate with Andrew Melville and seven strong presbyterians, on the general questions at issue between king and kirk.
In the same year he was appointed constant moderator to the Glasgow presbytery in the absence of the bishop, and encountered such opposition that the privy council ordered the presbytery to receive him under pain of rebellion.
The following year he was rebuked for endeavoring to extend the judicial powers of the presbytery to the decision of criminal cases.
In 1609 Sharp took part in the Falkland conference, which was intended to make matters easy for the bishops at the general assembly.
On 15 May 1610 he was appointed to the Scottish court of high commission, and held the office till 11 August 1614.
He died in May 1615, having been twice married: first, to Mary Fowlls, widow of John Houlden of Balwill, on 1 September 1593, by whom he had two sons, David and Christian, and two daughters; and, secondly, to Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Gale of Eastwood, by whom he had a son James.
Only one of his works survives, "Doctrinae Christianae brevis explicatio", printed by Robert Waldegrave in Edinburgh in 1599.
Igor Vladimirovich Mukhin (born 19 November 1961), also known as Igor Vladimirovich Moukhin, is a Russian photographer.
After graduating from college, Mukhin worked in a project institute.
From 1985 to 1986 he attended classes at the studio of prominent Moscow photographer Alexander Lapin.
He later spent several years working with samizdat rock musicians.
Since 1989 he has been working as an independent photographer.
Mukhin is known for his photographs of Soviet rock musicians of the perestroika period, including Viktor Tsoi, Boris Grebenshchikov, and Petr Mamonov.
His projects have included "The Soviet Monuments", "The Soviet Bench", "Fragments of Evident Propaganda", "The Soviet Children's Playgrounds", "Night Moscow", "Girls", "Moscow in Winter: Heavy Breath of Winter" and "The Province.
Some of the photographs from these projects were shown at the Tretyakov gallery and La Maison Rouge in Paris in 2007.
In the mid-1990s, Mukhin worked on documentary projects about Moscow and provincial Russia.
In 1999, Mukhin received a grant from the Paris Mayor's office to work on a project titled "Lovers in Paris" sponsored by FNAC (Fonds national d'art contemporain) and the French Committee to commemorate the year 2000.
Mukhin usually uses rangefinder cameras including the Leica M6 and black and white film.
His work has been published in many Russian magazines and in foreign editions such as "Rolling Stone", "GEO", "Elle", "Vogue", "Le Monde", "Libération", "Esquire", and "Time" among others.
Alto de Santana ("Santana Heights") is a name commonly used, especially by business, to refer to an upper middle class area of Santana district in São Paulo city, Brazil.
The term is used informally to refer to the bairro of Vila Santana "(Santana Village)" and the elevated region of the Santana bairro.
Among the major routes that pass through the region are: "Voluntários da Pátria street, Francisca Júlia street, Pedro Doll street, Doutor Guilherme Cristoffel street and Doutor Luis Lustosa da Silva street".
In Alto de Santana is located the Baruel Mansion, an old castle founded in the 19th century.
The region is classified by CRECI (Federal Council of Real Estate) as Value of Zone B like other upper middle class areas of the capital: Brooklin, Cerqueira César e Paraíso.
It is found in the Pacific Northwest of North America.
In Alberta it has been collected only in the extreme southeastern corner.
Reported food plants include "Artemisia tridentata".
The term Afroasiatic "Urheimat" refers to the hypothetical place where speakers of the proto-Afroasiatic language lived in a single linguistic community, or complex of communities, before this original language dispersed geographically and divided into separate distinct languages.
This speech area is known as the "Urheimat" ("original homeland" in German).
Afroasiatic languages are today distributed in parts of Africa and Western Asia.
The contemporary Afroasiatic languages are spoken in the Near East, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, and parts of the Sahara/Sahel.
The various hypotheses for the Afroasiatic "Urheimat" are distributed throughout this territory; that is, it is generally assumed that proto-Afroasiatic was spoken in some region where Afroasiatic languages are still spoken today.
However, there is argument as to which part of the contemporary Afroasiatic speech area corresponds with the original homeland.
The earliest written evidence of an Afroasiatic language is an Ancient Egyptian inscription dated c. 3400 BC (5,400 years ago).
Symbols on Gerzean pottery resembling Egyptian hieroglyphs date back to c. 4000 BC, suggesting a still earlier possible date.
This gives us a minimum date for the age of Afroasiatic.
However, Ancient Egyptian is highly divergent from proto-Afroasiatic (Trombetti 1905: 1–2), and considerable time must have elapsed in between them.
Estimates of the date at which the proto-Afroasiatic language was spoken vary widely.
They fall within a range between approximately 7,500 BC (9,500 years ago) and approximately 16,000 BC (18,000 years ago).
According to Igor M. Diakonoff (1988: 33n), proto-Afroasiatic was spoken c. 10,000 BC.
According to Christopher Ehret (2002: 35–36), proto-Afroasiatic was spoken c. 11,000 BC at the latest, and possibly as early as c. 16,000 BC.
These dates are older than dates associated with most other protolanguages.
Culturally this falls within the period of the Halfan culture which may have been proto-Afroasiatic.
Supporters of a non-North or Northeast African origin for Afroasiatic are particularly common among those with a background in Semitic or Egyptological studies, or amongst archaeological proponents of the "farming/language dispersal hypothesis" according to which major language groups dispersed with early farming technology in the Neolithic.
The leading linguistic proponent of this idea in recent times is Alexander Militarev.
Arguments for and against this position depend upon the contested proposal that farming-related words can be reconstructed in Proto-Afroasiatic, with farming technology being widely thought to have spread from the Levant into North Africa and then the Horn of Africa.
Militarev, who linked proto-Afroasiatic to the Levantine Natufian culture, that preceded the spread of farming technology, believes the language family to be about 10,000 years old.
He wrote (Militarev 2002, p. 135) that the "Proto-Afrasian language, on the verge of a split into daughter languages", meaning, in his scenario, into "Cushitic, Omotic, Egyptian, Semitic and Chadic-Berber", "should be roughly dated to the ninth millennium BC".
But an Asiatic origin need not be associated exclusively with the migration of agricultural populations: according to linguists, words for dog (an Asian domesticate) reconstruct to Proto-Afroasiatic as well as words for bow and arrow, which according to archaeologists spread rapidly across North Africa once they were introduced from the Near East i.e. Ounan points.
A scenario that also fits the linguistic evidence is one in which Afroasiatic languages were introduced into Africa together with advanced hunting techniques before the subsequent introduction of agriculture.
The Horn of Africa, particularly the area of Ethiopia and Eritrea, has been proposed by some linguists as the origin of the language group because it includes the majority of the diversity of the Afroasiatic language family and has very diverse groups in close geographic proximity, sometimes considered a telltale sign for a linguistic geographic origin.
Although at Lake Turkana microlithic arrowheads appear in southern Africa (71,000 BP) and with the Aterian culture (30,000 BP) suggests that arrowheads "may" have been an invention originating in Africa taken into the Near East by a pre-Afroasiatic late glacial migration.
At the site of Nataruk in Turkana County, Kenya, obsidian bladelets found embedded in a skull and within the thoracic cavity of another skeleton, may suggest the use of stone-tipped arrows as weapons.
After the end of the last glacial period, use of the bow seems to have spread to every inhabited continent, including the New World, except for Australia.
However, these finds predate by far any proposed date for the evolution of Afroasiatic.
In the next phase, unlike many other authors Ehret proposed an initial split between northern, southern and Omotic.
The northern group includes Semitic, Egyptian and Berber (agreeing with others such as Diakonoff).
He proposed that Chadic stems from Berber (some other authors group it with southern Afroasiatic languages such as Cushitic ones).
Another proposal is that Semitic is an offshoot of a northern family of Afroasiatic languages, including Berber, and possibly Egyptian.
It then entered the Levant and was possibly spread by what Juris Zarins calls the Syro-Arabian nomadic pastoralism complex, spreading south along the shores of the Red Sea and northeast around the edge of the "Fertile Crescent".
It is thought that Semitic speakers then crossed from South Arabia back into Eritrea.
In contrast, Bender proposed on linguistic grounds that Cushitic (found in the Horn of Africa) shares important innovations with Semitic and Berber, and that these three split off early from the others, while still near an original homeland of all Afroasiatic.
Igor Diakonoff proposed the Eastern Sahara region, specifically the southern fringe of the Sahara.
Lionel Bender proposed the area near Khartoum, Sudan, at the confluence of the Blue Nile and White Nile.
The details of his theory are widely cited but controversial, as it involves the proposal that Semitic originated in Ethiopia and crossed to Asia directly from there over the Red Sea.
This could also potentially solidify Bender's argument, in that scholars today believe that there is a relationship between the Cushitic branch and the Chadic Branch; arguing that perhaps Chadic descends from Cushitic.
Prior to Colonialism the Hausa peoples of present-day Niger, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, and Chad were not united as a single polity, but rather they existed as a sequence of seven city-states (situated between the Niger River and Lake Chad); each with their own Sovereign dynasty named after their shared common progenitor known as Bayajidda, who apparently came from the "East" to which a great deal of scholars attribute to being the "Middle East', though this is contested.
Each City-State were their own entities but were intertwined through trade, language, religion, customs, and ethnic identity/relations; hence comprising a sizable cultural stock that had greater trade links with larger states and empires such as the Ghana Empire, Mali Empire, Kanem-Bornu Empires, etc.
In current day southwestern Chad and northeastern Cameroon in the Lake Chad Basin, there are several ethnic groups that also speak an Afroasiatic language similar to the Hausas.
They are known as respectively: the Biu–Mandara, Tumak, Nancere, Kera, Dangaléat, Mukulu, Sokoro, etc.
Together with the Hausa, they collectively comprise the Chadic branch of the Afro-Asiatic family.
There are also remnants of a civilization on the Cameroon side of Lake Chad that date back to at least the sixth Century BCE; which is suspected of being the remains of the late Sao civilisation, which scholars suspect as being the result of waves of Nubian migrations into West Africa (further substantiating the claims that 'Bayajidda' hence Hausas, came from the "East").
Sub-groups such as the Gamergu, Kanembu, Sokoro, and Musgum all claim relations to one another as well as descent from the Sao.
The Nostratic language family is a proposed macrofamily grouping together a number of language families including Indo-European, Uralic, Altaic, and more controversially Afroasiatic.
Following Pedersen, Illich-Svitych, and Dolgopolsky, most advocates of the theory have included Afroasiatic in Nostratic, though criticisms by Joseph Greenberg and others from the late 1980s onward suggested a reassessment of this position.
Ilya Yabonovich and other linguists, in examining the differences between the various members of the Afroasiatic family have realised that all of the old etymologies for this group were inherently semitocentric.
The differences between Chadic, Omotic, Cushitic and Semitic, were wider than those seen between any members of the Indo-European family and as wide as some of the differences seen within and between separate language families, for example, Indo-European and Altaic.
Certainly the exclusion of Afroasiatic from the controversial Nostratic family has simplified matters of phonemics, not having to include the complex patterns seen in Afroasiatic languages.
Allan Bomhard (1994) retains Afroasiatic within Nostratic, despite his admission that Proto–Afroasiatic is very different from the other members of the proposed linguistic Nostratic superfamily.
As a result, he suggests it was probably the first language to have split from the Nostratic linguistic superfamily.
Recently, however, a consensus has been emerging among proponents of the Nostratic hypothesis.
Greenberg in fact basically agreed with the Nostratic concept, though he stressed a deep internal division between its northern 'tier' (his Eurasiatic) and a southern 'tier' (principally Afroasiatic and Dravidian).
The American Nostraticist Bomhard considers Eurasiatic a branch of Nostratic alongside other branches: Afroasiatic, Elamo-Dravidian, and Kartvelian.
Similarly, Georgiy Starostin (2002) arrives at a tripartite overall grouping: he considers Afroasiatic, Nostratic and Elamite to be roughly equidistant and more closely related to each other than to anything else.
Sergei Starostin's school has now re-included Afroasiatic in a broadly defined Nostratic, while reserving the term Eurasiatic to designate the narrower subgrouping which comprises the rest of the macrofamily.
Recent proposals thus differ mainly on the precise placement of Dravidian and Kartvelian.
There was a major forest fire, the Dogrib Fire, in 2001, which threatened the community.
In 2003, a major bridge was reconstructed in Bearberry.
"Sour gas" is mined in and around Bearberry.
The area west of the community is described as "pristine wilderness area [that] is also home to the bear, wolf and cougar whose prey includes wild horses."
Sugar panning, or simply panning, is a method for adding a candy "shell" to candy or nuts.
Popular candies that employ this process in their manufacture include dragées, M&M's, gobstoppers, and jelly beans.
Jelly beans use "soft" panning while the other three are examples of "hard" panning.
The process was initially invented in 17th century France to make jordan almonds.
A dragée pan, a spherical or oval pan mounted on an angled spinning post, is used.
The pan is open to the air to allow ingredients to be added and the syrup to dry.
The centers are put in the dragée pan, and syrup is added.
The pan spins, and the syrup is evenly distributed over the centers and dries on as a layer.
Soft panned layers can be quite thick and do not well preserve the shape of the center.
Hard panned layers take longer to dry and can be as thin as 10-14μm.
The choice for centers is wide, but they must be strong enough to not break during the tumbling.
Nuts should be dried and sealed, such as with gum arabic and flour, to prevent oils from escaping and discoloring the candy shell.
Other centers may be precoated for sealing or to improve the syrup sticking to the center.
Chewing gum is difficult to pan without precoating.
Soft panning uses a syrup that will not crystallize, such as glucose.
To assist in drying, powdered sugar or caster sugar is added during the tumble.
Prays ruficeps is a moth of the family Plutellidae.
It is found in Northern and Central Europe.
Janzen Jackson (born December 14, 1990) was an American football safety.
After playing college football for the University of Tennessee and McNeese State, he was signed by the New York Giants as an undrafted free agent in 2012.
Jackson initially attended Carencro High School in Lafayette, Louisiana until 2007 where his father, was the head coach of the football team.
There, Jackson honed his skills as a corner under his father's tutelage.
After totaling 93 tackles, 5 interceptions and blocking seven kicks as a junior, he was named Class 5A All-State by the LSWA.
After his father returned to McNeese State, Jackson attended Alfred M. Barbe High School in Lake Charles, Louisiana, where he made 92 tackles and intercepted 5 passes as a senior.
He was also named Class 5A All-State a second time and received All-American honors by "USA Today" and "SuperPrep".
In addition, Jackson participated in the U.S. Army All-American Bowl.
Considered a five-star recruit by "Rivals.com", Jackson was listed as No. 2 cornerback in the 2009 class.
He originally committed to LSU on February 23, 2008, but rethought his choice on National Signing Day 2009, when he signed a national letter of intent to play football for Tennessee.
I love Tennessee.
I have known Coach Orgeron for a while and I love him.
But to realize that if you play defense at Tennessee, then you are going to know what Monte Kiffin knows is special.
He invented his own defense (Tampa 2) and has been so good for so long, and now he is going to teach me what he knows.
Despite Tennessee's depth in the defensive backfield, Jackson was expected to contribute as a true freshman in 2009.
He arrived at Tennessee weighing 175 lbs, but bulked up to 192 lbs.
According to head coach Lane Kiffin, Jackson "already covers like an SEC cornerback and hits like an SEC safety and has a chance to lineup alongside Eric Berry as a starter on September 5 against Western Kentucky."
Until midseason, Jackson had started all but two of the Volunteers' games and had emerged as one of the better freshman players in the Southeastern Conference (SEC).
He was suspended for the week 9 game against Memphis for violating team rules.
On November 12, 2009, Jackson and fellow freshmen teammates Mike Edwards and Nu'Keese Richardson were arrested after an armed robbery attempt at a Pilot station on Cumberland Avenue in Knoxville, Tennessee.
Less than two weeks later, charges against Jackson were dropped because a police investigation found that he had no prior knowledge of the alleged attempted robbery.
On November 24, he was reinstated to the Tennessee football team.
After recording 37 tackles, a sack, an interception, a forced fumble, and a fumble recovery, Jackson was named to Rivals.com's 2009 SEC All-Freshman Team for his standout play.
As a sophomore in 2010, Jackson started all 12 regular season games and compiled 65 tackles, 4 tackles for loss, a sack, 9 passes defended and 5 interceptions and was named to the All-SEC second team voted by the league's coaches.
On August 24, 2011, the University of Tennessee announced that Janzen Jackson was released from the football team for unspecified reasons.
On August 28, Jackson enrolled at McNeese State University, where his father, Guidry, played and coached for the McNeese State Cowboys football team.
On April 29, 2012, Jackson signed with the New York Giants as an undrafted free agent.
On August 13, 2012, Jackson was waived by the team.
On February 21, 2013, Jackson signed with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League.
He was released after playing five games.
Jackson has a son named Ethan.
It is found in Central and Southern Europe, Algeria, Morocco, the Caucasus, Armenia, Turkey, North-Western Iran, Syria, Israel and Lebanon.
Darlington power station refers to a series of two coal-fired power stations situated in Darlington in County Durham, North East England.
The first station was opened on the town's Haughton Road in 1900.
It was positioned alongside the East Coast Main Line for the easy delivery of coal.
The station needed replacing in the 1930s, and so a new station was built on the site.
The station's construction cost £324,000, but was marred by numerous accidents and deaths.
The new station opened in May 1940.
It had three large hyperboloid reinforced concrete cooling towers and three brick built chimneys.
The station had a generating capacity of 57 megawatts (MW).
The Central Electricity Generating Board gave 12 months notification of the station's closure in October 1975.
The station closed the following year, on 25 October 1976.
The cooling towers were demolished on 28 January 1979, and the chimneys were taken down by hand in 1978.
The Station building was demolished in 1979.
Dry gas seals are non-contacting, dry-running mechanical face seals that consist of a mating (rotating) ring and a primary (stationary) ring.
When operating, lifting geometry in the rotating ring generates a fluid-dynamic lifting force causing the stationary ring to separate and create a gap between the two rings.
Dry gas seals are mechanical seals but use other chemicals and functions so that they do not contaminate a process.
Machined-in lift profiles on one side of the seal face direct gas inward toward an extremely flat portion of the face.
The gas that is flowing across the face generates a pressure that maintains a minute gap between the faces, optimizing fluid film stiffness and providing the highest possible degree of protection against face contact.
The seal's film stiffness compensates for varying operations by adjusting gap and pressure to maintain stability.
Grooves or machined ramps on the seal direct gas inward toward the non-grooved portion.
The action of the gas flowing across the seal generates pressure that keeps a minute gap, therefore optimizing fluid film stiffness and providing protection against face contact.
The use of these seals in centrifugal compressors has increased significantly in the last two decades because they eliminate contamination and do not use lubricating oil.
Non-contacting dry gas seals are often used on compressors for pipelines, off-shore applications, oil refineries, petrochemical and gas processing plants.
The first dry gas seal for a compressor was patented by Kaydon Ring & Seal in 1951 when it was known as Koppers Corporation.
Field applications of dry gas seal designs were completed in 1952.
From that first dry gas seal ever manufactured for a centrifugal compressor in 1951, Kaydon Ring & Seal has been instrumental in developing the dry gas seal into one of the most reliable and maintenance free sealing solution available today.
John Crane Inc. issued a patent for dry gas seals in 1968 with field applications beginning in 1975, though the technology is now widely available among seal manufacturers.
When the technology is aimed at correcting the problems with dry gas film environments by eliminating friction.
The patented spiral-groove (constant depth / variable diameter) technology of the dry gas seal allows for easy lifting and separation of seal faces during operation.
Also the dry gas seal lift geometry can be unidirectional or bidirectional, depending on the specific design of the lifting geometry.
Priest is a 2011 American action horror film directed by Scott Stewart and stars Paul Bettany as the title character.
It is loosely based on the Korean comic of the same name by Hyung Min-woo.
In an alternate universe, humanity and vampires have warred for centuries.
After the last Vampire War, a veteran Warrior Priest lives in obscurity until his niece (Lily Collins) is kidnapped by vampires.
The film was released on , 2011.
The film earned over $78 million at the box office against a $60 million production budget, but it was panned by critics, who, while noting the film's visual style, criticized the movie's use of genre clichés.
A centuries long war between humans and vampires has devastated the planet's surface and led to a theocracy under an organization called The Church.
They constructed giant walled cities to protect mankind and developed a group of elite warriors, the Priests, to turn the tide against the vampires.
The majority of the vampires were killed, while the remainder were placed in reservations.
With the war over, the Clergy disbanded the Priests.
Outside the walled cities, some humans seek out a living, free from the totalitarian control of the Church.
Priest (Paul Bettany) is approached by Hicks (Cam Gigandet), the sheriff of Augustine, a free town.
Priest learns that his brother and his wife, Shannon - Priest's girlfriend before he entered the priesthood - were mortally wounded in a vampire attack, and Priest's niece, Lucy (Lily Collins), was kidnapped.
Hicks asks for Priest's help in rescuing Lucy.
Priest asks the Clergy to reinstate his authority, but Church leader Monsignor Orelas (Christopher Plummer) does not believe the vampire story and refuses, not wanting to discourage the idea that the Church completely defeated the vampires for fear of compromising their authority over the city.
Priest defiantly leaves the city and Orelas sends three Priests and a Priestess to bring him back.
Priest and Hicks arrive at Nightshade Reservation where humans called Familiars, people infected with a pathogen that makes them subservient to the vampires, live alongside a number of the surviving vampires.
After a fierce battle, the pair discovers that most of the vampires have taken shelter in Sola Mira, a vampire hive where Priest lost several of his comrades during a major battle.
Priestess (Maggie Q) joins them at Sola Mira, revealing a bond with Priest.
The trio destroys a Hive Guardian vampire, then discover that the vampires have bred a new army and dug a tunnel out of the mountain towards a town called Jericho.
The other three Priests have arrived at Jericho just as night falls and an armored train arrives, unleashing hundreds of vampires upon the population.
The vampires are led by a powerful and mysterious human wearing a black hat.
When the three Priests reject Black Hat's offer to join him, he kills them all.
The next morning, Priest, Priestess and Hicks arrive in Jericho and discover the town empty and the three dead Priests crucified.
Priest and Priestess share an intimate moment where she makes her move, hoping that now that Shannon has died, he would no longer feel bound to her.
Priest, who is clearly not over Shannon, gently refuses.
Priest realizes that the vampires have been using the trains to travel by day and attack the free towns by night, with the walled cities at the end of the train line.
Hicks believes an attack on the cities would be unwise because of the sun, but Priest reveals that factories, producing massive clouds of smoke and ash, have permanently deprived the city of sunlight, so the vampire attack would be a slaughter.
Hicks threatens Priest, claiming he will shoot him unless he promises to let Lucy live whether she has been infected or not.
(Priest had earlier revealed to Hicks, who is in love with Lucy, that if they discovered Lucy had been infected as a Familiar, he would kill her.)
Hicks does not understand why Priest, who is basically a stranger to Lucy, cares so much about her.
Priestess reveals that Lucy is actually Priest's daughter, and that his brother, Owen, stepped in as a husband and a father when Priest was taken by The Church.
While Priestess rushes ahead to plant a bomb on the railroad tracks, Priest and Hicks board the train to rescue Lucy.
Battling vampires and Familiars, the two are finally overpowered by Black Hat just as they find Lucy.
Black Hat is revealed as one of the Priests who was defeated in the final attack on Sola Mira and a close friend of Priest.
After being captured, the vampire Queen gave him her blood, turning him into the first Vampire-Human hybrid who can survive the sun.
As Priest fights Black Hat, Lucy discovers the truth about her parentage.
Priestess battles several Familiars, finally placing the explosives on her motor bike and crashing it into the train engine.
The explosion and subsequent derailment kills the vampires and engulfs Black Hat in fire, while Hicks, Priest, Priestess, and Lucy are able to escape.
Priest returns to the city and confronts Monsignor Orelas during Mass, telling him of the burnt train containing the vampires' bodies, but not the Queen's.
He proves this by throwing a vampire head onto the floor and shocking everyone in the room.
Orelas still refuses to believe him, declaring that the war is over, while Priest says that it is just beginning.
Outside the city Priest meets Priestess, and she reveals that the other Priests have been notified and will meet them at a rendezvous point.
Priest sets off into the sunset.
"Priest" is directed by Scott Stewart and written by Cory Goodman.
The film is based on the supernatural horror and action Korean comics "Priest" by Min-Woo Hyung.
The project was first announced in March 2005 when the studio Screen Gems bought Goodman's spec script.
In January 2006, Andrew Douglas, who directed "The Amityville Horror", was attached to direct "Priest".
In June 2006, actor Gerard Butler entered negotiations to star as the title character, and filming was scheduled to start in Mexico on , 2006.
Filming did not proceed and, by three years later, director Douglas had been replaced by Stewart, while Butler had been replaced in the starring role by Paul Bettany.
Stewart and Bettany had previously worked together in the Screen Gems film "Legion".
With a budget of $60 million, filming began in August 2009 in Los Angeles, California, and it concluded in November 2009.
The film was the most expensive production from Screen Gems, to that date, and as of 2018 is still tied for third most expensive, behind only "" and "".
Tokyopop flew Min-Woo Hyung to where production was taking place so the comics' creator could visit the art department and discuss the film with Stewart.
The film diverges from the comics in following a different timeline of events and adding elements of the sci-fi western, cyberpunk and post-apocalyptic science fiction genres.
The director described "Priest"s vampires as not being human in origin, and humans bitten by vampires became familiars instead.
Since the vampires were intended to move quickly, they were fully computer-generated for the film.
While vampires are harmed by sunlight in most lore, the film's vampires are instead photosensitive, being albino cave-dwellers.
Stewart said, "They are the enemy we don't really understand, but we fought them for centuries.
The director also called "Priest" a homage to "The Searchers" with the title character being similar to John Wayne's character and the vampires being similar to the Comanche.
The animated prologue for the film was created by American animator and director Genndy Tartakovsky.
"Priest" was released in the United States and Canada on , 2011.
The film's release date changed numerous times in 2010 and 2011.
It was originally scheduled for , 2010, but it moved earlier to , 2010 to fill a weekend slot when another Screen Gems film, "", was postponed.
When the filmmakers wanted to convert "Priest" from 2D to 3D, the film was newly scheduled for release on , 2011.
It was delayed again to , 2011 so the film could attract summertime audiences.
"Priest" was released outside the United States and Canada on , 2011 in four markets.
It grossed an estimated over the weekend, with "decent debuts" of in Russia and in Spain.
It performed poorly in the United Kingdom with under $700,000.
The film was released in the United States and Canada on , 2011 in with 2,006 having 3D screenings.
It grossed an estimated over the weekend, ranking fourth at the box office.
Its performance was considered subpar compared to similar films in the "Underworld" series and "Resident Evil" series.
To date, "Priest" has grossed an estimated , of which was from North America.
"Priest" was largely panned by critics.
Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 16% based on reviews from 92 critics and reports a rating average of 3.9 out of 10 with a consensus that ""Priest" is admittedly sleek and stylish, but those qualities are wasted on a dull, derivative blend of sci-fi, action, and horror clichés".
At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 41 based on 13 reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews".
CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade audiences gave the film was a "C+" on an A+ to F scale.
Chaturanga Dandasana (IAST: "Caturaṅga Daṇḍāsana") or Four-Limbed Staff Pose, also known as Low Plank, is a Yoga asana, in which a straight body parallel to the ground is supported by the toes and palms, with elbows at a right angle.
The name comes from the Sanskrit words "chatur" (IAST:catur) meaning "four", "anga" (IAST: aṅga) meaning "limb", "danda" (IAST:daṇḍa) meaning "staff" (refers to the spine, the central "staff" or support of the body), and "asana" (IAST:Āsana) meaning "posture" or "seat".
In Chaturaṅga Daṇḍāsana the hands and feet are on the floor, supporting the body, which is parallel to and lowered toward, but not touching, the floor.
It looks much like a push up, but with the hands quite low (just above the pelvis), and the elbows kept in along the sides of the body.
When performed correctly, it can help prepare the body for arm balance asanas by strengthening important muscles and promoting good form.
In the sequences it is performed on an exhale, and the dṛṣṭi दृष्टि is the nāsāgra (नासाग्र) with the face pointing forwards.
In Sūrya Namaskāra A it is the fourth count (catvāri, चत्वारि), and in Sūrya Namaskāra B it is performed on the fourth, eighth and twelfth counts (catvāri, चत्वारि;aṣṭa,अष्ट;dvādaśa,द्वादश respectively).
In yoga practice without vinyasa the asana is simply held for a period of time (for instance, 30 seconds) with continuous breathing.
If unable to perform a standard Caturaṅga Daṇḍāsana, it can be done with the knees on the floor.
This asana helps to tone arm and forearm muscles and develops flexibility and power in the wrists, as well as toning abdominal organs and building repository muscles.
Due to the unique musculotendinous nature (this joint is not a junction of bones, but rather supported by muscles and tendons alone) of the scapulothoracic joint and unusual mobility of the glenohumeral joint involved in movement of the shoulder and upper back, weak serratus anterior may lead to winging of the shoulder blades in Caturaṅga Daṇḍāsana and cause shoulder and/or elbow pain and/or clicking.
Particularly in cases were Caturaṅga Daṇḍāsana or other chest strengthening asanas are practiced excessively, to the point of muscle exhaustion, which causes weaker, but anatomically more suited, muscles to hand their support responsibility over to stronger, but perhaps less ideal muscles; in the case of Caturaṅga Daṇḍāsana the triceps and pectoral muscles can sometimes compensate for weak serratus anterior.
This may require concerted professional help to re-educate the muscles and re-engage muscle action in the serratus anterior during such movements.
Lumbar hyperextension and hip flexion is a result of weakness in this asana, which can be corrected by activating the hamstrings.
The hips are adducted, rotated internally, and exhibit neutral extension.
The ankle is dorsiflexed.
The scapula is protracted or neutral.
The elbow is flexed, and the wrist is extended.
The obliques, rectus abdominis and psoas minor work eccentrically to stabilize the spine, and the spinal muscles work concentrically.
The hamstrings, adductor magnus and gluteus maximus work concentrically in the legs, while the psoas major, iliacus, and rectus femoris work eccentrically keeping the hip in neutral extension.
The vastii and articularis genus provide knee extension.
The gastrocnemius and soleus modulate the tibialis anterior to dorsiflex the foot, and finally the intrinsic and extrinsic foot muscles are active.
In the upper body the serratus anterior works eccentrically to prevent winging of the scapula.
The muscles of the rotator cuff include the subscapularis (which protects the front of the joint), and the infraspinatus and teres minor (which work to externally rotate the humerus against the pull of the pectoralis and coracobrachialis).
The pectoralis major, pectoralis minor, coracobrachialis, and triceps work eccentrically.
Exploding Head is the second album from the noise rock band A Place to Bury Strangers.
"In Your Heart" was released as the first single and "Keep Slipping Away" was released as a single on Monday 7 December 2009 in the UK.
The album was a critical success and received a metascore of 79 out of 100.
Christian belief states that the name of God is not a human invention, but has divine origin and is based on divine revelation.
Respect for the name of God is one of the Ten Commandments, which some Christian teachings interpret to be, not only a command to avoid the improper use God's name, but a directive to exalt it through both pious deeds and praise.
This is reflected in the first petition in the Lord's Prayer addressed to God the Father: "Hallowed be Thy Name".
Going back to the Church Fathers, the name of God has been seen as a representation of the entire system of "divine truth" revealed to the faithful "that believe on his name" as in or "walk in the name of the our God" in .
In those who bear the name of God are destined for Heaven.
presents the teachings of Jesus as the manifestation of the name of God to his disciples.
The Bible usually uses the name of God in the singular (e.g. Ex.
8:1), generally using the terms in a very general sense rather than referring to any special designation of God.
However, general references to the name of God may branch to other special forms which express his multifaceted attributes.
Scripture presents many references to the names for God, but the key names in the Old Testament are: "God the High and Exalted One", "El Shaddai" and "YHWH" (on the meaning of the latter name there is almost no agreement).
The Old Testament usually uses the name of God in the singular (e.g. Ex.
8:1), generally using the terms in a very general sense rather than referring to any special designation of God.
However, the general name of God may branch to other special names which express his multifaceted attributes.
The simplest form by which God is referred to in the Old Testament is El, likely derived from His being first and foremost.
(see proper names of earlier Canaanite gods) Elohim (singular Eloah) is likely derived from the same root and points to God as being strong and mighty, able to judge and to strike fear.
Elyon refers to elevation and being exalted.
Adonai has a similar context and refers to God as a powerful ruler.
Similarly, El Shaddai, derived from "shad" i.e. Lord, also points to the power of God.
Yahweh is the principal name in the Old Testament by which God reveals himself and is the most sacred, distinctive and incommunicable name of God.
Based on Lev, 24:16: "He that blasphemes the name of Yahweh shall surely be put to death", Jews generally avoided the use of Yahweh and substituted Adonai or Elohim for it when reading Scripture.
The pronunciation of YHWH in the Old Testament can never be certain, given that the original Hebrew text only used consonants.
The English form Jehovah was formed during the Middle Ages by combining the Latinization of the four consonants YHWH with the vowel points that Masoretes used to indicate that the reader should say Adonai when YHWH was encountered.
Thus Jehovah was obtained by adding the vowels of Adonai to the consonants of YHWH.
Jehovah appears in Tyndale's Bible, the King James Version, and other translations from that time period and later.
Many English translations of the Bible translate the Tetragrammaton as "", following the Jewish practice of substituting Adonai for it.
In the same sense as the substitution of Adonai, the Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Bible to Greek mainly used the word "Kyrios" (meaning 'lord') for YHWH.
Apostle Paul was likely familiar with the use of the term Kyrios in the Septuagint and used it in his letters to refer to Jesus, thus signifying his divinity.
The pronouncement "I Am that I Am" in Exodus 3:14, in rabbinical scholarship taken as a gloss on the meaning of the Tetragrammaton, was in Hellenistic Judaism rendered as .
In the iconographic tradition of Eastern Christianity, it is common to depict Christ with a cruciform halo inscribed with the letters Ο, Ω, Ν for "He Who Is".
While the Old Testament has a wide variety of names and epithets that refer to God in Hebrew, the Greek text of the New Testament uses far fewer variants.
The essential uses of the name of God the Father in the New Testament are "Theos" (θεός the Greek term for God), "Kyrios" (i.e. Lord in Greek) and "Patēr" (πατήρ i.e. Father in Greek).
The Aramaic word "Abba" (אבא), meaning "Father" is used by Jesus in and also appears in Romans 8:15 and Galatians 4:6.
In the New Testament the two names Jesus and Emmanuel that refer to Jesus have salvific attributes.
The name Jesus is given in and and in both cases the name is not selected by humans but is received by angelic messages with theological significance, e.g. the statement in Matthew 1:21 "you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save his people from their sins" associates salvific attributes to the name Jesus.
Emmanuel which appears in Matthew 1:23 may refer to , and does not appear elsewhere in the New Testament, but in the context of ("I am with you always, even unto the end of the world") indicates that Jesus will be with the faithful to the end of the age.
According to Ulrich Luz, the Emmanuel motif brackets the entire Gospel of Matthew between 1:23 and 28:20, appearing explicitly and implicitly in several other passages, setting the tone for the salvific theme of Matthew.
The names of the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit are inherently related in the New Testament, e.g. with Jesus' instruction to His disciples at the end of the Gospel of Matthew :"make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit".
The Greek word "pneuma", generally translated "spirit", is found around 385 times in the New Testament.
The English terms "Holy Spirit" and "Holy Ghost" have identical meanings, with the former having become the usual term in the 20th century.
The First Epistle of John then contrasts this with the "spirit of error" in .
Although in some modern cultures names are simply labels and designators that distinguish one item from another, in Christian theology the names of God have always had much deeper meaning and significance.
In the religious sense, the names of God are not human inventions, but have divine origin and are based on divine revelation.
Veneration of the name of God goes back to the Old Testament, and as in , the Ten Commandments state: "You shall not make wrongful use of the name of the L your God".
Christians teachings view this commandment as not simply an avoidance of the use of the name of God, but as a directive to exalt it, through both pious deeds and praise.
In Christian teachings, the name of God is not simply a label, but involves divine mysteries that require and preempt respect and praise.
Louis Berkhof states that the issue surrounding the use and interpretation of the names of God provide a theological puzzle in that given that God is "infinite and incomprehensible", His names transcend human thought, yet they allow Him to be revealed to humans as he descends to what is finite and comprehensible.
Thus the name of God has always been revered in the Christian tradition, and has been associated with His presence.
The traditions and the hymnody of Christian liturgy have for long emphasized the importance of acting in the name of God, e.g. the Sanctus (which may go) states: "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord".
Going back to Church Fathers such as Cyril of Alexandria, in Christian teachings the name of God has been seen as a representation of the entire system of "divine truth" revealed to the faithful "that believe on His name" as in or "walk in the name of the Lord our God" in .
This is further shown in Jesus' Farewell Discourse to His disciples at the end of the Last Supper, in which He addresses the Father and in and states:
In those who bear the name of God are destined for Heaven.
In Christian teachings, although the people of God bear the name of God, even they can offend the name of God by transgressing against the nature of God, and disobeying His commandments, as in : "For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you, even as it is written."

White Stuff is a British fashion and lifestyle brand that sells women’s, men’s and kids' clothing, accessories, homeware and gifts in over 115 shops in the United Kingdom, shops in Germany, via mail-order catalogues and through its website.
The brand has become known for its traditional British styles, idiosyncratic boutique stores and innovative marketing campaigns.
White Stuff was founded in 1985 when two friends, George Treves and Sean Thomas, decided to form a business to fund their love for skiing.
Starting under the name “Boys from the White Stuff”, their printed T-shirts and sweatshirts became instantly popular in the alpine region of Val d'Isère.
The pair opened the first White Stuff Clothing store in London in 1991.
White Stuff was founded in 1985 by two friends, George Treves and Sean Thomas.
Keen skiers, the pair decided to work together to find a way of funding their passion.
They devised a business plan to sell T-shirts with abstract motifs that would appeal to skiers.
They thought up the name "Boys from the White Stuff" – a play on the title of the popular film and TV series “Boys from the Blackstuff” by Alan Bleasdale.
Sean Thomas sold the initial batch of 100 T-shirts very quickly in the company’s inaugural year, while George Treves stayed at home in the UK to work on a course at catering college.
The following season, they began printing sweatshirts as well as T-shirts which, according to Treves, “started to gain Alpine kudos as a grass roots level; it had an aspirational value for holidaymakers who had seen ski workers wearing it”.
Treves and Thomas toured the French Alpine ski resort town of Val d'Isère, selling their products in hotels and bars from a suitcase.
During the off-seasons, when they could not sell their garments, Treves worked as a decorator and Thomas as a driver.
At the turn of the 21st Century, Treves and Thomas were continuing to design White Stuff’s clothing lines.
In February 2004 Thomas and Treves hired Sally Bailey, former Brand Director of Miss Selfridge, to help develop the brand.
Over the next five years, Bailey moved the White Stuff label away from its original image as a winter wear retailer to begin focusing on a more bohemian, urban audience.
Bailey stepped down from her position as CEO in 2013 and was replaced by Jeremy Seigal, formerly of Watson and The Perfume Shop.
In 2018, Jo Jenkins, previously at Marks and Spencer joined the company as CEO.
By 2018, the company had grown to have more than 115 stores across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, including stores in Guernsey and Isle of Man.
The White Stuff Foundation was founded in May 2010, in celebration of the company's 25th anniversary.
Today the foundation is based in Lambeth, London.
White Stuff Clothing stated their aim to fulfil 25 pledges to show White Stuff's social and environmental commitments, and in particular aims at helping disadvantaged young people.
Currently the White Stuff Foundation supports more than 100 small and local charities in the UK.
These are predominantly in the urban areas close to White Stuff's stores and distribution centres, and every branch of White Stuff is partnered with its own charity.
The White Stuff Foundation also supports two charities in India and two in Denmark.
Donations accepted by the White Stuff Foundation go towards supporting these partner charities.
White Stuff stores are responsible for hosting their own fundraising events.
This has led to the creation of many campaigns, including Surf Relief, Give a Gnome a Home, National Wear a Tea Cosy on Your Head Day and Charity Flip Flops, as well as local events, such as bake sales and raffles throughout each year.
White Stuff stores will also sell the props used as part of their window displays at the end of every season, with proceeds going to the White Stuff Foundation.
In 1991, the first White Stuff shop was opened in Clapham, London.
White Stuff boutiques are, according to the company website, “more than just shops, they are places where people can meet and socialise.”
White Stuff regularly hosts events inside its stores (including the regular White Stuff Book Club), allows customers to bring pets inside with them, and has dedicated areas for children with colouring books and dens.
Some White Stuff stores include their own cinemas, pick ‘n’ mix counters and bespoke changing rooms decorated in themed styles.
White Stuff has more than 100 stores including Edinburgh, Nottingham, Manchester and Battersea.
The Curtiss Model 57 Teal was an American monoplane amphibian designed and built by the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company.
Two versions were built, a three-seater and four-seater but only one of each was built.
The Teal was a monoplane amphibian with the pusher engine pod-mounted above the wing center section.
It was designed for the private user, but due to the economic pressures of 1930s America only one three-seater (Teal A-1 registered "N969V" ) and one four-seater (Teal B-1 registered "N970V") were built.
The Noctes Ambrosianae, a series of 71 imaginary colloquies, appeared in "Blackwood's Magazine" from 1822 to 1835.
The earlier ones had several different authors, including John Gibson Lockhart, William Maginn, James Hogg and Professor John Wilson, but from 1825, with the 19th in the series, the contributions by Wilson predominate, and he eventually wrote all or most of 39 of the dialogues, as well as parts of some others.
The scene is usually set in Ambrose's Tavern in Edinburgh, and the central characters are "Christopher North" (Wilson himself), "Timothy Tickler" (based on Robert Sym, 1750-1840, previously a Writer to the Signet), and the "Ettrick Shepherd" (based on James Hogg).
Several other characters, imaginary or based on real people, including the "English Opium Eater" (Thomas de Quincey) and "The tailor o' Yarrow Ford" (David Brunton) occur in some episodes.
The series is particularly noted for the expressive Scots dialogue of the Ettrick Shepherd.
Fractured is the second novel in the "Atlanta" series from bestselling author Karin Slaughter.
This book was published in 2008.
The books also feature Angie Polaski and Faith Mitchell.
Slaughter also writes the Grant County series.
The audiobook is narrated by Phil Gigante.
Six months ago, Atlanta homicide detective Faith Mitchell's police captain mother was the focus of an investigation that resulted in her retirement and the firing of six narcotics officers.
It was a righteous bust, but the cops want to protect their own, and Faith, along with the entire Atlanta police force, simmers with rage at the man responsible, GBI agent Will Trent.
Now Faith and Will are thrown together on a shocking murder/kidnapping case involving some of the wealthiest and most powerful families in the city, and neither one of them is happy about the pairing.
But Faith gradually discovers that not only is Will not the verminous heel she expected him to be, he is a sleuth par excellence, and Will must deal with a bully from his past who is now a victim and whose irrational hostility threatens the investigation.
As the case begins to center on dyslexia, Will waits nervously to see if anyone will notice his own, and he and Faith race frantically from the dormitories of Georgia Tech to the halls of one of Atlanta's exclusive private academies to keep another corpse from surfacing.
It is located a few kilometers south of the city of Chimaltenango in Guatemala.
It was formerly known as "Finca la Alameda" and renamed to Los Aposentos in 1929.
An area of 0.15 km², including the lakes was declared a national park in 1955.
It holds 16 vehicles (tied with the MV "Nimpkish"), 138 passengers and crew, and its maximum speed is .
The "Mill Bay" operated in the Brentwood Bay-Mill Bay route across Saanich Inlet on Vancouver Island.
The Brentwood Bay to Mill Bay ferry started operation in November 1924 by two former naval officers, Kennaird and Williams, and it is the oldest continuous ferry service on the coast of British Columbia.
Initial service by the Cascade Freight and Trading Company was provided with a 22-year-old wooden hulled coastal steamer the SS "Cascade", which was altered to allow cars to drive on or off the bow and the stern.
The "Cascade" underwent many more alterations over the years, including replacement of her steam engines with internal combustion engines,
and was eventually rechristened the "Brentwood".
Cascade Freight and Trading Company was bought by Coast Ferries Ltd. in 1945.
In the 1950s the more-than-50-year-old "Brentwood" was aging and in need of replacement.
Coast Ferries Ltd. contracted out the construction of a new steel hulled ferry to the Victoria Machinery Depot firm in Victoria.
On July 20, 1956 the "Mill Bay" entered service across the Saanich Inlet route and for two years both the "Mill Bay" and the older "Brentwood" both crossed the inlet while the portion of the Island Highway over the Malahat pass was being paved.
In 1969 Coast Ferries Ltd. was bought out by BC Ferries (that had formed in 1960).
Thus "Mill Bay" is a vessel four years older than the company that currently runs her and is the oldest working ferry in the BC Ferries fleet.
The Mill Bay terminal was used for a scene during the filming of the 1970 movie "Five Easy Pieces" that starred Jack Nicholson
On May 29, 1989 "Mill Bay" ran aground on the beach just south of the Mill Bay ferry terminal.
No damage resulted and she was pulled safely back into deeper water.
The subsequent investigation discovered that the captain at the time had fallen asleep since he had just participated in the Swiftsure Yacht Race.
On July 5, 1989 the "Mill Bay" was crossing Saanich Inlet when a problem arose with the fuel line and the engine lost power.
As the ferry drifted the fuel line was repaired and the ferry eventually made it to shore under her own power.
In 2000 BC Ferries proposed eliminating the service provided by the "Mill Bay" but local protest was strong enough to counter the proposal and preserve the service.
In 2001 the "Mill Bay" was removed from service for two months in the summer to undergo refurbishment that included replacement of several sections of steel plating in the hull, extension of the bridge, and the addition of radar.
In addition, the terminals in Mill Bay and Brentwood Bay were upgraded with all repairs to the terminals and vessel costing approximately $3.8 million (CAD).
The 80th anniversary of the ferry route was celebrated on November 27, 2004 at the Brentwood Bay terminal and aboard the "Mill Bay".
On February 1, 2005 three men fell into Brentwood Bay when their canoe capsized.
Reacting to the incident the crew aboard the "Mill Bay" picked up two of the men and the third was picked up by the Brentwood Bay Coast Guard Auxiliary.
Raymond J. Parker reported in 2009 that the "Mill Bay" was used by cyclists in a significant shortcut for a Vancouver Island 300 km bike route known as "Tsunami II".
"Mill Bay" is equipped with three lanes for cars, two with no height restriction and one lane that passes under the superstructure for the wheelhouse.
Since the trip across the inlet takes only 20 minutes "Mill Bay" does not have very many amenities.
The "Mill Bay" is powered by an L. Gardner and Sons model 8L3 straight-eight engine that generates .
She burns diesel fuel at the rate of 14 litres/hour (3.7 gallons/hour) and is the most fuel efficient active vessel in the BC Ferries fleet.
In a July 2007 report prepared for the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation on traffic capacity problems over the Malahat Drive it was noted that BC Ferries' 2000 study of the "Mill Bay" service noted it was uneconomical.
The provincial government has assured service through 2011, but BC Ferries is reported to be looking to sell service fulfillment on the route to another provider.
The fuel rebate for fares aboard the "Mill Bay" dropped from ten percent to five percent on January 25, 2010.
BC Ferries refers to the route served by the "Mill Bay" as "The Island’s Most Beautiful Shortcut".
The news release states that the route will be closed from May 2 – 31, 2011, and will be serviced by the MV "Klitsa" beginning June 1, 2011.
In 2012, Bhavani taluk has been reorganised to form the new Anthiyur taluk.
It comes under Gobichettipalayam Revenue Division.

Walter Gramsch (born 15 January 1897, date of death unknown) worked in a high position for the State Railways in Nazi Germany, and was involved in the 20 July plot against Hitler.
He used his position to feed information to the West German Gehlen Organization.
In particular, he spied on Ernst Wollweber, a Soviet sabotage expert.
Gramsch was thus in a good position to report on his activities.
This resulted in, among other things, the upset of several of Wollweber's attempts to smuggle products past the Western embargo into East Germany.
In the mid-1950s Gramsch was 'recalled' to West Germany.
This was to protect him from the East German SSD (coincidentally, then run by the same Wollweber he had formerly spied on) which had become recently successful in discovering and executing large numbers of spies.
It was published in 2005 by Indiana University Press.
It has an award-winning, concomitant website entitled Oceans of Kansas Paleontology.
A revised, updated, and expanded edition was published in 2017.
In "Oceans of Kansas" Everhart discusses the state of the land during the Late Cretaceous and earlier, when the area was covered with water.
The geologic record shows that ancient lifeforms such as marine reptiles, pteranodons, and toothed birds inhabited the general area both in and out of the water.
Everhart also covers the discovery of the fossils and geographic records as well as the competition between E. D. Cope and O. C. Marsh to collect them.
Aplysia vaccaria, also known as the black sea hare and California black sea hare, is a species of extremely large sea slug, a marine, opisthobranch, gastropod mollusk in the family Aplysiidae.
This sea hare species lives in the northeast Pacific Sea off California, United States and Baja California, Mexico, including the Gulf of California.
The black sea hare can grow to be very large: the longest recorded specimen measured when crawling (and thus fully extended), and weighed nearly .
Unlike "Aplysia californica", the body of this species is relatively firm, and the parapodia are joined behind the siphon.
Unlike many other members of the same family and genus, this species is incapable of producing ink.
This species eats brown seaweeds and kelp, which give the animal its typically very dark coloration.
A total of eight teams contested the league.
The regular season was played between 24 September 2009 and 14 February 2010, followed by a post-season involving the top four teams.
The schedule was announced on 5 June 2009.
The 48 minute game switched to a 40-minute game.
Pre-season training began for a majority of clubs during the last week of July.
A pre-season tourney, dubbed the NBL Top End Challenge, involving all eight sides was contested during August in Darwin, Northern Territory.
Wollongong Hawks win Top End Challenge.
The 2009–10 National Basketball League Finals played between 18 February 2010 and 12 March 2010, consisting of two best-of-three semi-finals and final series in which the higher seed hosts the first and deciding third game.
The NBL tie-breaker system as outlined in the NBL Rules and Regulations states that in the case of a tie of three or more teams, winning percentage in games played only between those teams will determine order of finish.
Under that system, Wollongong (5-3) will finish second, Townsville (4-4) third and Gold Coast (3-5) fourth.
Greece took part at the Eurovision Song Contest 1992 in Malmö, Sweden, represented by Cleopatra with the song "Olou Tou Kosmou I Elpida" (Όλου του κόσμου η Ελπίδα).
Cleopatra was selected by Ellinikí Radiofonía Tileórasi (ERT), the Greek broadcaster, to represent the country at the contest in Sweden.
Cleopatra performed 5th on the night of the contest, following Turkey and preceding the France.
At the close of the voting the song had received 94 points, placing 5th in a field of 23.
The fifth-place in 1992 equaled the fifth-place in 1977 and it was the best place that Greece ever had until 2001.

She Plays for Bristol City W.F.C..
She's on loan at Oxford United W.F.C. Although primarily a left-back, who's won most of her England caps playing in central defence, she has also played as a midfielder at club level.
She has also previously represented English Universities.
Yorston began her career with Southampton Saints.
She was inspired by Southampton coach Sue Lopez.
In the 2003 close season, Yorston joined Fulham Ladies with whom she made her England debut in 2003.
Soon after this she suffered a couple of stress fractures that kept her out of the game for nearly a year.
She joined Bristol Academy in the 2005 close season, and went on to have three seasons as club captain.
She joined Arsenal Ladies in July 2009, but returned to Bristol in 2010.
She was loaned out to Keynsham Town to maintain fitness ahead of Bristol's FA WSL season, which began in April 2011.
At the end of the 2014 season, Yorston left Bristol Academy to join FA WSL 2 side Yeovil Town.
Yorston won 19 caps at Under-19 level and also played at Under-23 level before joining the England senior team.

After completing her Masters she began studying for an MPhil at the FA National Women's Player Development Centre at Loughborough University.
He is most famous for inventing the Savage Model 99 lever-action rifle, which remained in production for over 100 years, and founding Savage Arms.
However, his most lasting and valuable inventions may be radial tires, and it has been argued, the modern detachable box magazine used in almost all modern military firearms.
He also invented an early torpedo and built and raced cars.
He was born in Kingston, Jamaica, British West Indies.
His father was Welsh, a special commissioner to the West Indies, charged with setting up an educational system for the slaves emancipated in 1834.
In the late 1880s he took his family to Australia, homesteading in a covered wagon.
He came to own what was then the largest cattle ranch in Australia.
Eleven years later he sold it and bought a coffee plantation in Jamaica.
In 1892 he moved to Utica, New York, and hired himself to a railroad, the Utica Belt Line Street Railroad (See List of New York railroads).
He also got part-time work at a gun factory, the Utica Hammer Magazine Company.
Savage and his son Arthur John began designing guns.
Six years later, he patented a lever-action rifle able to shoot then-modern guncotton military center-fire cartridges with .303-caliber spitzer bullets.
Savage invented a novel rotary magazine rifle.
A benefit of this magazine was that it had a cartridge counter on the left side of the receiver that enabled the shooter to tell how many cartridges remained in the magazine.
Lacking sufficient manufacturing capacity the first 9600 (plus or minus ) Model 1895 rifles were contracted to be built by Marlin Repeating Arms and are so marked with the JM proof mark.
In 1894, Savage started Savage Arms in rented space on Hubbell street in Utica, New York to produce his new rifle.
Slightly later, in 1897, he filed for the patent on a nearly identical gun with a removable box magazine.
It stayed in production until 1999.
The modern removable box magazine often seen on military rifles was invented in 1908 by
It did not come into wide use until his patent expired in 1942 with the obvious exception of the family of rifles designed by James Paris Lee and adopted by the USN and the British Empire; first as the Lee–Metford and later as the Lee–Enfield rifles.
The box magazine has many attractive features that ensured its eventual dominance: shoulders to retain cartridges when it is removed from the rifle, operates reliably with cartridges of different lengths and is insertable and removable at any time with any number of cartridges.
This allows the operator to reload the gun infrequently, carry magazines rather than loose cartridges, and to easily change the types of cartridges.
It is assembled from inexpensive stamped sheet metal.
When empty the follower stops the bolt from engaging the chamber, informing the operator of the gun's emptiness before any attempt to fire.
Savage collaborated on the invention of the Savage-Halpine torpedo, which was eventually adopted by the Brazilian navy.
Although U.S. sea trials were successful, it was not adopted in the U.S., due to political considerations.
In 1901 Savage moved to Duarte, CA, and formed the Savage Tire company, a $5,000,000 San Diego, CA corporation formed to make tires and inner tubes.
Here, he invented radial tires as well as new production methods.
It was released as a single on February 6, 2006.
As well as the original version, the single included a number of remixes and another song by Tellier, Le Long De La Riviere Tendre.
The song's lyrics mention "Private Rico"; this refers to the character Juan Rico from Robert A. Heinlein's book "Starship Troopers".
Abel Head Pierce, known as Shanghai Pierce (June 29, 1834 – December 26, 1900) was a Texas rancher.
He was born in Little Compton, Rhode Island and was a direct descendant of John Alden and Priscilla Mullins, with nine generations in between.
He was related to Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, U.S. President Franklin Pierce, and Thomas Wentworth Pierce, builder of the Southern Pacific Railroad in Texas.
At the age of nineteen, "Shanghai" stowed away on a ship in the New York harbor.
He worked for his passage and arrived in Indianola, Texas, five months later without money or a job.
He went to work for W. B. Grimes as a ranch hand.
By shrewdness, hard work, and rugged determination he became an authority on cattle while working for Grimes.
How Pierce acquired the name "Shanghai" is a matter of speculation.
J. Frank Dobie reported that it was due to Pierce's resemblance to a banty Shanghai rooster: long-legged and short-panted.
Wharton County folklore holds that the name resulted from his ruthless business dealings.
Pierce died on December 26, 1900.
Pierce, Texas is named for him.
Ted de Corsia played Pierce in the 1957 film "Gunfight at the O.K. Corral".
Roy Roberts was cast as Pierce in a 1957 episode of the ABC/Desilu Productions television series "The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp", with Hugh O'Brian as Wyatt Earp, then the deputy marshal of Dodge City, Kansas.
Douglas Fowley guest-starred with Roberts in the episode.
George Tobias played Shanghai Pierce in the episode of the television series "Laramie", starring John Smith and Robert Fuller
The Rawlings Gold Glove Award, usually referred to as the Gold Glove, is the award given annually to the Major League Baseball players judged to have exhibited superior individual fielding performances at each fielding position in both the National League (NL) and the American League (AL), as voted by the managers and coaches in each league.
Managers are not permitted to vote for their own players.
Eighteen Gold Gloves are awarded each year (with the exception of 1957, 1985 and 2007), one at each of the nine positions in each league.
In 1957, the baseball glove manufacturer Rawlings created the Gold Glove Award to commemorate the best fielding performance at each position.
The award was created from a glove made from gold lamé-tanned leather and affixed to a walnut base.
Initially, only one Gold Glove per position was awarded to the top fielder at each position in the entire league; however, separate awards were given for the National and American Leagues beginning in 1958.
Iván Rodríguez has won the most Gold Gloves at catcher, with 13; all were won with the Texas Rangers or the Detroit Tigers (both American League teams), though Rodríguez has played in both leagues.
Johnny Bench, who spent his entire career with the Cincinnati Reds, leads National Leaguers in wins, and is second overall with 10 Gold Gloves.
Bob Boone, who is a member of one of four family pairs to win Gold Glove Awards, won seven between both leagues during his career.
Jim Sundberg has won six Gold Gloves, with Bill Freehan winning five.
Hall of Famers who have won as catchers include Bench, Carlton Fisk, and Gary Carter.
The other family pair to win Gold Gloves as catchers are brothers Bengie and Yadier Molina, who have won six awards between them .
Russell Martin set the record for putouts among winning catchers in 2007; he put out 1,065 batters for the Los Angeles Dodgers that season.
In the American League, the leader is Dan Wilson, with 1,051 putouts in 1997 though he did not win the Gold Glove Award for it.
Assist leaders include Carter (108 in 1980) in the National League and the major leagues and Sundberg (103 in 1977) in the American League.
No Gold Glove-winning catchers had posted errorless seasons until Johnson (1997) and Matheny (2003) each accomplished the feat in the National League within six years; their fielding percentages in those seasons were 1.000, and Matheny posted two other winning seasons with only one error and a .999 fielding percentage in his career.
Bengie Molina leads in the American League with a one-error, .999 fielding percentage season in 2002; Sherm Lollar also posted only one error in the award's inaugural season, but a reduced number of chances left his fielding percentage at .998.
Johnny Edwards and Johnson hold the major league record for double plays turned among winners, with 17 each.
Edwards doubled off 17 runners in 1964, and Johnson matched his total in 1997.
Bench holds the record for the least passed balls in a season, having allowed none in 1975.
Rodríguez (1999) and Boone (1988) lead the American League, with one allowed.
Rodríguez has the highest percentage of baserunners caught stealing, with a 60% mark set in 2001.
Bench is the National League leader; he threw out 57% of potential base-stealers in 1969.
He played at representative level for England, and at club level for Batley, and Leeds (World War II guest), as a , i.e. number 11 or 12, during the era of contested scrums.
George Brown won a cap for England while at Batley in 1945 against Wales.
George Brown played right-, i.e. number 12, in Leeds' 15-10 victory over Halifax in the 1942 Challenge Cup Final during the 1941–42 season at Odsal Stadium, Bradford, in front of a crowd of 15,250.
The media coverage of Catholic sex abuse cases is a major aspect of the academic literature surrounding the pederastic priest scandal.
Some date the current sexual abuse scandal to an article published in the "National Catholic Reporter" in 1985.
After that, the scandal remained at the fringes of public attention but did not become a focus of national attention until the mid-1990s when a number of books were published on the topic.
The topic became the focus of intense scrutiny and debate after the "Boston Globe" published a series of articles covering cases of sexual abuse.
John L. Allen, Jr., Vatican correspondent for the "NCR", has commented that many American Catholics saw the Vatican's initial silence on the "Boston Globe" stories as evidence of a lack of concern or awareness about the issue.
Allen described the Vatican's perspective as being somewhat skeptical of the media handling of the scandal.
In addition, he asserted that the Vatican viewed American cultural attitudes toward sexuality as being somewhat hysterical, as well as exhibiting a lack of understanding of the Catholic Church.
However, it was not until early 2002 that the "Boston Globe" coverage of a series of criminal prosecutions of five Roman Catholic priests thrust the issue of sexual abuse of minors by Catholic priests into the national limelight on an ongoing basis.
The coverage of these cases encouraged other victims to come forward with their allegations of abuse resulting in more lawsuits and criminal cases.
In a May 2002 interview with the Italian Catholic publication, "30 Giorni", Cardinal Oscar Maradiaga claimed that Jews influenced the "Boston Globe" to exploit the recent controversy regarding sexual abuse by Catholic priests in order to divert attention from the Israeli-Palestinian crisis.
This provoked outrage from the Anti-Defamation League, especially since Maradiaga had a reputation as a moderate and was regarded as a "papabile".
Before the "Boston Globe" coverage of the sexual abuse scandal in the Boston archdiocese, handling of sexual abuse allegations was largely left up to the discretion of individual bishops.
After the number of allegations exploded following the "Globe's" series of articles, U.S. bishops felt compelled to formulate a coordinated response at the episcopal conference level.
In addition to matters regarding priests, the "Boston Globe" also reported in 2002 on matters with church staff, including a pastoral care and CCD worker, Paul Merullo, and a teenager, in Woburn, Massachusetts, which had occurred in 2000 but only made public in 2001.
Merullo was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.
In 2003, the series of articles in the "Boston Globe" received a Pulitzer Prize for Public Service.
"The Globe" was honored, according to the Pulitzer website, "for its courageous, comprehensive coverage ... an effort that pierced secrecy, stirred local, national and international reaction and produced changes in the Roman Catholic Church."
On March 24, 2010, a report by "The New York Times" cited the Fr. Murphy case to accuse Pope Benedict XVI of a cover-up while he was head of the CDF in 1996.
However, Father Thomas Brundage, judicial vicar who presided at the Church's internal discipline trial of the case stated that even though his name and comments had been liberally and often inaccurately quoted in "The New York Times" and more than 100 other newspapers and on-line periodicals, he had never once been contacted by any news organization for comment.
He added that "Pope Benedict XVI has done more than any other pope or bishop in history to rid the Catholic Church of the scourge of child sexual abuse and provide for those who have been injured...on the day that Father Murphy died, he was still the defendant in a church criminal trial."
It was also claimed that "The New York Times" article used an incorrect translation of the document on which it based its claims.
Paolo Rodari of the Italian newspaper Il Foglio, wrote: "The computer-generated English version would support the NYT's allegations against Bertone and Ratzinger, but that same conclusion is not possible if a correct review of the sources is done."
He added that in the official Italian text written by the CDF, it is explained that either Fr. Murphy gives ‘clear signs of repentance’ or the canonical process will go to the end, including his dismissal from the clerical state.
But in the English version used by the NYT, not only were some passages omitted, but frequently the contrary was said.
Director of Apologetics and Evangelization for Catholic Answers, Jimmy Akin, also pointed out, "Back in 1996 the CDF did not have a mandate to handle cases of sexual abuse by priests... The reason that Weakland notified the CDF was not because the abuse of minors was involved but because the abuse of the sacrament of confession was involved."
In April 2010, there were reports of a letter signed by Cardinal Ratzinger in 1985, in which he allegedly dismissed a request to laicize a Father Stephen Kiesle, a California priest accused of molesting boys.
The Vatican responded that "...the letter followed a request from the priest himself for laicization, supported by the bishop.
At this stage, Father Kiesle was already dismissed from pastoral duties during the investigation, and he had no contact with any parishioners or children."
The Pope's involvement with the 1985 letter has been covered in a two-part feature by the BBC.
The Australian transport planning academic Paul Mees wrote, "Why did Ratzinger need to consider the request, Dawkins asks?
And why didn’t he report Kiesle to the police?
The answer is that Kiesle had already been reported to the police, convicted and sentenced.
After completing his sentence, Kiesle left the priesthood and wrote to the CDF asking to be formally defrocked.
Every year, some of the church's 410,000 priests quit."
Law professor John Coverdale, in a letter to "The New York Times", wrote, "The [Laurie Goodstein] story is so wrong that it is hard to believe it is not animated by the anti-Catholic animus that the New York Times and other media outlets deny harboring... My complaint here is not that the article misuses the word "defrock" but rather that by so doing it strongly suggests to readers that Cardinal Ratzinger delayed the priest's removal from the ministry.
Delaying laicization had nothing to do with allowing him to continue exercising the ministry, from which he had already been suspended.
Not only does the article fail to make these distinctions, it positively misstate the facts.
Its title is "Pope Put off Move to "Punish" Abusive Priest.""
According to "Crikey", "The Age" of 19 March 2010 reported that the Vienna Boys Choir "has been caught up in accusations that pedophile priests systematically abused their choristers."
On the same day, "The Australian" reported that "the crisis over sexual abuse in the Catholic Church has intensified" as a result of the choir scandal.
A number of books have been written about the abuse suffered from priests and nuns including Andrew Madden in "Altar Boy: A Story of Life After Abuse", Carolyn Lehman's "Strong at the Heart: How it feels to heal from sexual abuse" and the bestselling "Kathy's Story" by Kathy O'Beirne, which details physical and sexual abuse suffered in a Magdalene laundry in Ireland.
Ed West of "The Daily Telegraph" claimed Kathy Beirne's story was "largely invented", according to a book by Hermann Kelly, a Derry-born "Irish Daily Mail" journalist and former editor of "The Irish Catholic".

Gayakwadwada is the name of a large edifice in Pune, India which was built by the Sardar Gayakwad family as a residential place for it.
Sayajirao Gayakwad, the prince of Baroda state, would occasionally stay there.
Bal Gangadhar Tilak bought the place from Sayajirao in 1905 to serve as an office building for his "Kesari" and "Maratha" newspapers.
Tilak lived in a part of Gayakwada, and the place was occasionally used by Indian nationalists for their nightlong discussions concerning overthrow of British colonial rule over India.
(Tilak had popularized the annual Ganesh Chaturthi festival in Pune and Maharashtra --as the means to generating nationalist spirit among people in Maharashtra—by initiating the festival in the courtyard of Gayakwadwada.)
The edifice currently houses the offices of "Kesari" and mementos of Tilak, including his writing desk, original letters, and documents; and the first India national flag unfurled by Madame Cama.

John Newte (1656–1716) was a high Anglican clergyman best remembered as the defender of the lawfulness of church music.
John Newte was born at Ottery St Mary on 15 January 1656, the son of Richard Newte (1613-1678) Rector of Tidcombe and Clare.
John was the grandson of Henry Newte The Elder who had been the first Town Clerk of Tiverton after that town's incorporation in 1615 (Henry was succeeded in this office by his son Henry Newte The Younger).
He was educated at Blundell's School, and Balliol College, Oxford, where he later obtained a fellowship.
After Oxford he was appointed Chaplain to Lord Digby, then after the Restoration Chaplain to Lord de la Warr.
He was appointed Chaplain to Charles II although he appears not to have served owing to his suffering gout and his residence being distant from the royal court.
Newte championed many charitable causes: giving money for the building of St Georges Chapel, Tiverton; raising monies for the installation of an organ in St Peter's Church, Tiverton; and, leaving land to Balliol College to found an exhibition for a Blundell’s scholar in addition to having founded schools for the poor in Cove and Cullompton, Devon.
The National Portrait Gallery in London holds a line engraving of Newte by Michael Van der Gucht (after Thomas Forster).

Blue Peter Special Assignment was a factual BBC TV series broadcast in the 1970s and early 1980s, the first spin-off from the long running BBC series "Blue Peter".
It ran regularly from 1973 until 1981, usually at weekends on BBC1, and was heavily promoted on "Blue Peter" itself.
The concept for the series was developed after Valerie Singleton had presented a successful documentary 'special' with HRH Princess Anne when she had visited Kenya in 1971 (albeit narrated by Biddy Baxter).
The Special Assignment series was mainly produced by Edward Barnes and presented initially by Valerie Singleton and later by Peter Purves and Lesley Judd both of whom had been presenters on "Blue Peter" itself.
Series One featured Valerie Singleton looking at six European Capital Cities.
These included Rome, Paris, London, Edinburgh, Amsterdam and Brussels.
The first programme to be filmed was the one featuring Rome and included a personal address to the children of Britain from Pope Paul VI in The Vatican.
Series Two continued to feature Singleton looking at European Cities and included Dublin, York and Madrid.
Later series looked at Islands and included The Isle of Wight, The Isle of Man, Hong Kong, Malta and Venice, even though Venice had also featured in an earlier series as a 'city'.
Later the show began to look at famous houses or famous individuals and included biographies of Vivaldi, The Brontë Sisters, The Duke of Wellington, Saint Therese of Lisieux, Marie Antoinette and Rudyard Kipling and both Lesley Judd and Peter Purves began presenting the series in place of Singleton.
The series in 1977 was presented jointly by Peter Purves and Lesley Judd, with the theme of 'twin towns'.
The final series was co-presented alternately by Singleton and Peter Purves, being broadcast in 1981.
The series theme was Rivers, with Singleton examining The Yukon and Niagara, while Purves reported on The Tamar, The Tweed and The Singapore Rivers.
Spin off books were published covering the first two series.

Ivica Kalinić (born 26 March 1956 in Split) is a retired Croatian football manager and former player.
He has played for Hajduk Split, Maribor, Osijek, Tirol Innsbruck and Grazer AK.
He has coached Istra Pula, Posušje, Solin, Imotski, Uskok, Mosor, Široki Brijeg, Šibenik and Hajduk Split.
Having successfully managed NK Šibenik during his two years at the club (Šibenik finished 6th in the league during the 2008-09 season), Ivica Kalinić landed the job as Hajduk Split manager after Ante Miše resigned because of a defeat against NK Zadar in August 2009.
Kalinić managed only one game for Hajduk and that was the third round of the UEFA Europa League against MŠK Žilina on home ground.
After Hajduk conceded a goal in the 76th minute of the game, they were losing 1-2 on aggregate.
In the late minutes of the game, Kalinić suffered heart problems and was taken to the hospital.
He was clinically dead for 20 seconds and reanimated twice.
After recovering, he retired from managing and became sporting director at Hajduk Split where he remained until his full retirement in 2012.
It was completed in 1874 and opened on 1 November 1876; the reason for the delay was that the Wye Valley Railway which the branch line fed into, was not completed until the latter date.
It closed in 1935 when the rails buckled in the heat of the summer.
In 1866 the Wye Valley Railway Company announced that it would not build a line through the village of Tintern, but by-pass it.
To make up for this the company was forced to build a branch to the wireworks on the other side of Tintern.
The Wye Valley Amendment Act was passed on 14 June 1875 stating that "the company would forever maintain the branch and junction in good repair"; as well as setting the regulations on running the line.
By August 1875, before the opening of the branch, the Abbey Wireworks Company had stopped trading.
The line remained practically empty until the early 1880s when the works were taken over by the Abbey Wire and Tinplate Company; this venture was short lived and the works closed in 1901.
The privately owned locomotive was sold and from then on the branch was only used by horses for the sawmills and turnery works in the village.
The line closed in 1935.
Most of the tracks were lifted in 1941 and sent for scrap.
The junction with the Wye Valley Railway was lifted in 1945 and was the last part of the branch to be lifted.
The weigh house on the line survived until the late 1970s.
Today the bridge carrying the branch over the Wye is still standing.
It now carries a public footpath.
Born in 1957 in Naila, near the northern Bavarian town of Hof, Friedrich has a PhD in law and also studied economics.
From 1990 to 1991, Friedrich worked in the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and the economy department of the Germany Embassy in Washington, D.C.
Friedrich began his national political career as an aide to Michael Glos, a senior CSU official in parliament.
He was deputy chairman of the investigating committee for party donations from 1999 until 2002 and for electoral fraud from 2002 until 2004.
Following the 2005 federal elections, when his party joined a "Grand Coalition" with Angela Merkel as Chancellor, Friedrich became deputy chairman of the parliamentary group under the leadership of Volker Kauder, covering the portfolio of housing and development.
Between 2007 and 2009, he was one of 32 members of the Second Commission on the modernization of the federal state, which had been established to reform the division of powers between federal and state authorities in Germany.
In the negotiations to form a coalition government following the 2009 federal elections, Friedrich led the CDU/CSU delegation in the working group on transport and building policies; his co-chair from the FDP was Patrick Döring.
From 2009, Friedrich led the CSU in parliament, replacing Peter Ramsauer.
During that time, he was said to have enjoyed a good relationship with Merkel and to have often sided with national interests over Bavarian ones.
Economic policy was widely seen as his passion as he has supported raising the retirement age to 67 despite opposition from CSU leader Horst Seehofer.
He also played a behind-the-scenes part in crafting Germany's response to the euro zone crisis.
On 3 March 2011 Friedrich succeeded Thomas de Maizière as Federal Minister of the Interior who replaced Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg.
The fact that Friedrich, like Guttenberg, came from the northern Bavarian area of Upper Franconia meant that his appointment ensured the regional balance of power within the CSU was maintained.
On the occasion of the sixtieth anniversary of the diplomatic relations between German and India, Friedrich participated in the first joint cabinet meeting of the two countries’ governments in Delhi in May 2011.
On 7 June 2011 he attended the state dinner hosted by President Barack Obama in honor of Chancellor Angela Merkel at the White House.
In early 2012, Friedrich became Chancellor Angela Merkel’s first Cabinet member to suggest Greece’s exit from the euro.
In an interview with "Der Spiegel", he said Greece would have better chances of overhauling its economy and restoring growth if it left the euro area.
In late 2012, Friedrich called for the immediate suspension of the visa-free regime for Serbia and Macedonia after more than 7,000 citizens of the two countries applied for asylum in Germany within one year.
In the wake of the US National Security Agency's (NSA) internet surveillance scandal around PRISM in 2013, Friedrich was long perceived as not particularly devoted to investigating the full scope of NSA spying activities in Germany.
Instead, he defended the NSA's methods and promptly demanded legislation changes, in order to be able to expand surveillance of communication traffic by the German Bundesnachrichtendienst as well.
In an effort to point out how valuable information provided by the NSA can be for Germany, he argued that forty-five terror attacks had been prevented by the Prism program, including five in Germany; however, he soon back-peddled, unable to pinpoint the five instances.
In a later interview with "Münchner Merkur" newspaper, Friedrich held that Edward Snowden was not a victim of political persecution.
In the negotiations to form a so-called Grand Coalition following the 2013 federal elections, Friedrich led the CDU/CSU delegation in the working group on internal affairs and justice; his co-chair from the SPD was Thomas Oppermann.
Friedrich was sworn in as Federal Minister of Food and Agriculture in the third cabinet of Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel on 17 December 2013.
He resigned on 14 February 2014, reacting to imminent legal investigations into incidents during his tenure as Federal Minister of the Interior.
He is accused of betraying state secrets about legal investigations into Social Democrat Party (SPD) heads during the coalition negotiations after the federal elections in 2013.
Prosecutors complained that the leak may have compromised their inquiry.
The investigations showed MP Sebastian Edathy's link to a globally-operating child pornography syndicate, and plans to take up an investigation against Edathy on suspicion of possessing such material.
The rock is so named for the visual effect of a "hump" it creates on the western face of the mountain.
Humpback Rocks, along with a well maintained trail and visitors' center, are located in the Blue Ridge Mountains near Waynesboro, Virginia in Augusta County and Nelson County.
Located six miles (10 km) south of the northern entrance to the Blue Ridge Parkway, Humpback Rocks stands out from many other mountain summits in the Blue Ridge due to its exposed rocky summit, in contrast to the heavily vegetated peaks of surrounding mountains.
As is the case for most of the surrounding mountains, such as Old Rag Mountain, Humpback Rocks is underlain by an enormous granite formation, created during the Grenville Orogeny on the ocean floor about a billion years ago.
About 400 million years after the Grenville Orogeny during the Catoctin Formation, basaltic magma was deposited, forming a layer of greenstone over the granite.
Over time, sand and rock sedimented on the ocean floor forming quartzite and sandstone deposits.
Finally sedimentation of shells and skeletons of foraminifera resulted in deposition of a layer of limestone.
Approximately 700 million years after the Grenville Oregny, the Iapetus Ocean began to close resulting in the Alleghenian Orogeny where slabs of granite and rock were transported westward and eventually thrust up over the limestone bed around it, forming Humpback Rock and the Blue Ridge Mountains.
From 1851 until the early 20th century, wagoners hauling cargo used the bygone road Howardsville Turnpike to go between Howardsville and the Shenandoah Valley.
Often the travelers camped at Humpback Gap.
Notable is the rock fence, reputedly built by slaves of a plantation owner, that separates the gap and Greenstone Overlook.
The early European settlers of the Appalachian Mountains forged a living from the native materials so abundant around them.
Hickory, chestnut and oak trees provided nuts for food, logs for building and tannin for curing hides, while the rocks were put to use as foundations and chimneys for the houses and in stone fences to control wandering livestock.
Many self-sufficient farms sprang up in the Humpback Mountain area.
Today, visitors can tour a collection of 19th Century farm buildings.
The Mountain Farm trail provides access to the cabin and various outbuildings.
The area also houses a visitor center with new exhibits, a picnic area, and trails.
Hiking Humpback Rocks is a relatively short hike following a trail loop.
With a roughly 45 minute hike to ascend to the peak, and a 20-25 minute descent, this ranks as one of the shorter hikes along the Blue Ridge, however it remains one of the most rewarding.
The peak affords a spectacular 360 degree view of the surrounding terrain.
To the north you can see into the southern section of Shenandoah National Park, to the east check out the patchwork of farms, to the southwest you see thick woods and mountain ridges of the George Washington National Forest.
Hikers may continue to follow the Trail for , passing along the top of a cliff with views to the south and east before descending to a blue blaze trail.
This trail leads into the Humpback Rocks Picnic Area.
Continuing past Humpback Rocks itself, the summit of Humpback Mountain is only a few minutes further.
Coming from the north on the Appalachian Trail there is an AT shelter called The Paul C. Wolfe shelter.
The Appalachian Trail can also be accessed from the Humpback Gap parking area.
Southbound hikers can reach it by continuing south on the Humpback Rocks trail.
Northbound hikers can reach it taking the one mile (1.6 km) blue blazed path at the northern end of the parking lot, or the one mile (1.6 km) white blazed path just off of the Howardsville Turnpike.
The word 'barnbrack' is a play on the Anglicised Irish word "Barmbrack", a type of bread that contains fruit.
Barnbrack separated in 2003, after the premature death of Quinn’s wife, Deirdre, aged 55.
While Barnbrack have had many popular songs, such as "The Fly" and the "Unicorn Song", the band's only noted chart success was with a single called "Belfast", written by Lisburn-born man and band member Alex Quinn.
The song described the feelings felt by an expatriate, who is planning to return to Ulster and the city he left behind.
The song was released on the Homespun label.
It entered the UK Singles Chart on 16 March 1985, and reached #45; it was in the chart for several weeks.
In 2009, the "Belfast Telegraph" reported that, after six years apart, the former members of the band were planning a reunion.The band is now back together and is currently touring Northern Ireland.
Twin Buttes Reservoir is an artificial lake located about southwest of the city of San Angelo, Texas, and immediately upstream from Lake Nasworthy.
With the financial support of the Upper Colorado River Authority, construction on Twin Buttes Dam to form the reservoir was completed in 1963.
The dam is an unusual one – it dams the Middle and South Concho Rivers separately; a stabilization channel runs between the two sides of the lake.
Water levels fell significantly during the 2010–13 Southern United States drought and remained low into 2014.
Twin Buttes Reservoir was established to provide flood control, irrigation, water conservation, and a primary drinking water source for San Angelo and the surrounding communities in Tom Green County.
The lake also serves as a recreational venue for fishing, boating, and swimming.
The dam and reservoir are owned by the United States Bureau of Reclamation, and are managed by the City of San Angelo.
Twin Buttes Reservoir has been stocked with species of fish intended to improve the utility of the reservoir for recreational fishing.
Fish present in the lake include largemouth bass, white bass, catfish, and crappie.

The NZR U class was a class of two 4-6-0 steam locomotives built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1904 for the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company.
When that company was nationalised in 1908, they passed into the ownership of the New Zealand Railways and received the designation U.
Weighing with a tender of , they could haul express trains easily at on mainline railways that were flat or had only a light grade.
It had coupled driving wheels, which were large for the period, a working steam pressure of , and diameter cylinders with piston strokes.
The handsome U locomotives were more than capable of making up lost time, with mile-a-minute runs recalled with pride by Manawatu railway employees.
Although they were fast and powerful, the U locomotives were unable to survive a programme of standardisation undertaken between 1925 and 1935 to eliminate small locomotive classes that were costly to maintain in favour of large, homogeneous types that provided economies of scale.
Admiral Sir Richard Lee KCB KTS (c. 1765 – 5 August 1837) was a prominent officer of the British Royal Navy who served in the American Revolutionary War, the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars.
His early career was marked by his participation in a number of important battles during the American war, during the French Revolutionary Wars he spent an unremarkable period of time in the Caribbean, but during the Napoleonic Wars he was again prominent, participating heavily in a number of important engagements.
In 1812 Lee was promoted to rear-admiral and was unable to get an appointment, his future as a serving officer in doubt.
Although he never again served in an active capacity, he continued to receive promotions and rewards for his lengthy service, both from the British and Portuguese royal families.
He died at his home in Walmer, Kent in 1837 at the age of 72 as a full admiral.
Richard Lee was born in approximately 1765, entering the Royal Navy at the age of just 12 as a midshipman on the sloop HMS "Speedwell", then captained by Commander John Harvey.
Lee later transferred to the ship of the line HMS "Triumph", which was attached to the fleet under Admiral Sir George Rodney.
With Rodney, "Triumph" participated in the victory over the Spanish at the Battle of Cape St Vincent and the inconclusive Battle of Martinique against the French during 1780.
Later in the year, Rodney's fleet sailed to New York City and "en route" seized the captured armed Jamaica ship "Lion".
Lee was made master of "Lion" and cruised the coastline near Sandy Hook, on one occasion fighting a brief engagement with the American privateer "Retaliation", which was driven into Neversink.
For his services, Lee was promoted to lieutenant and awarded a large financial reward from the merchants of New York.
In 1781, Lee returned to Britain and joined first HMS "Recovery" and then HMS "Raisonnable", in which he participated in the relief of Gibraltar during the Great Siege.
With the fleet under Lord Howe, Lee subsequently participated in the indecisive Battle of Cape Spartel.
Lee remained in service during the peace that followed, initially on HMS "Swallow" and then on the fourth rate HMS "Centurion" in the West Indies under Rear-Admiral Philip Affleck.
Under Affleck's patronage, Lee received a promotion to commander in HMS "Serpent" and acted as a convoy escort during the opening months of the French Revolutionary Wars, for which service he was given substantial financial rewards by the convoy's merchants and insurers.
"Serpent" was subsequently deployed in support of allied forces during the siege of Nieuwpoort, returning in June 1794 when Lee was promoted to post captain.
Lee's first full command was HMS "Hind" in the English Channel, followed by HMS "Greyhound" in the Caribbean and the HMS "Assistance" in the Channel once more.
In 1802, Lee survived the loss of "Assistance" in a shipwreck off Dunkirk, when two hired maritime pilots grounded the vessel on a sandbar.
Two men were drowned in the wreck, and Lee was subsequently admonished for placing too much trust in hired pilots.
The pilots were each imprisoned for six months.
After three years unemployed, Lee returned to service in early 1805, taking over the 74-gun HMS "Courageux" and joining the squadron under Sir Richard Strachan in the Bay of Biscay.
On 4 November 1805, "Courgueux" was heavily engaged at the Battle of Cape Ortegal, in which four French ships of the line that had escaped from the Battle of Trafalgar were defeated and captured.
In 1806, Lee took command of HMS "Monarch", and again took part in an important action while serving with the blockade squadron under Sir Samuel Hood off Rochefort.
At the Action of 25 September 1806, seven French ships attempted to break out the port for the West Indies.
Intercepted within hours by Hood's squadron of ships of the line, the French fled, only "Monarch" managing to keep in touch.
In the ensuing engagement, four French frigates were captured although "Monarch" suffered considerable damage to her masts and rigging.
Over the next several years, Lee was employed in the blockade of the Tagus, assisting the flight of the Portuguese Royal family in 1807 and negotiating peace with the Spanish forces in the Rio de la Plata.
In 1809, after his return to Britain, Lee joined the disastrous Walcheren Expedition, and remained in "Monarch" in the North Sea until 1812, when his ship was deemed no longer serviceable and broken up.
Advanced to rear-admiral, Lee was unable to secure a commission at sea and effectively retired from the service, although he continued to rise in rank and stature: in 1815 he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath and in 1816 was awarded the Order of the Tower and Sword by the Portuguese Royal family in recognition of her services towards them.
He died on 5 August 1837, at his home in Walmer, Kent.

He resigns to become a driver of rickshaw...
One day, Philomena comes face to face on Ravi.
She finds degrading that he is reduced to this job, for her, while he possesses all the qualities to obtain a more gratifying job and as high as his ambitions.
It is then, contrary to all expectations, that supervisor's post releases itself in the forest region of Kargudi, but it is subjected to a condition : the deposit of a strong sum of money (10 000 rupees), by Ravi and he has only, for it, of 72 hours.
In the meantime, the hunger torments them again...

She promises to him to return to him after this wholesome lapse of time, in the letter which she sent him before leaving him.
While being at it, Philomena, wanting to save a little girl, is knocked down by the biggest of the fates, by David's vehicle.
Whereas Ravi, aboard a bus, finds an enormous sum of money.
After careful consideration, he decides to use the money found to pay the guarantee of his future work.
And there, committed, here he is left for Kargudi.
Upon his arrival, he gets acquainted with a strange character, Manikkum (Delhi Ganesh) which forces to him to take the hand of his daughter.
The man is mentally disturbed since the marriage of his unique daughter, Rukumani (Révathi) (also called Ruku) broke off, for lack of not having been able to honor the dowry, the sum of which it lost in a bus, recently.
It turns out that Ruku works for Ravi, as housewife of her house.
She turns out to be very naive but especially to very awkward, causing enormous concerns to Ravi, who reprimands her severely every time.
In the capital, Philomena tells its setbacks to David.
Together, they go to meet Ravi, but on the spot, they realize that the young man is not there anymore.
To Kargudi, Ruku, who is a kleptomaniac also, steals the harmonica of Ravi, which afterward, remembers itself, in the solitude of the forest, with tenderness and sadness, his beloved Philomena, who does the same from her part, through their song, "Nilavu Thoongum Neram"...
David has to leave to Kargudi for his business and leave only Philomena...
The fate wants that Ravi works in the David's forest domain.
Both men meet and appreciate mutually.
In the passage, David recommends expressly to Ravi to take back Ruku to his service department.
Indeed, she was dismissed, some times previously, by Ravi, exceeded, by her clumsiness.
She who came to put back to Ravi, his wallet lost a little earlier, just catches up her, while she was seriously going to flop.
The young woman succumbs to her rescuer.
Sekhar, (Chandrasekhar), son of big family, who passed by Kargudi, breaks down with its car.
While he looks for some water, he meets Ruku and is in love with her in the first look.
He went to the girl's chosen by his parents, whom he gives up definitively.
On his return, he quarrels with his father who wants to disinherit him because of the refusal of the arranged marriage, Sekhar outstrips him by abandoning everything, for the beautiful eyes of Ruku and leave his cosy nest.
Following a new thoughtlessness of Ruku, Ravi the slap in front of his father, Manikkum.
This one made sick of life, explains him his failures, in particular another time, when he lost an enormous sum of money in a bus, among others ...
Ravi makes the link with the sum which he found formerly, and deducts that he is bound to the misfortunes of Ruku and his father.
He regrets bitterly his attitude past with them, in the point to express it to his boss, David.
The latter makes understand to Ravi, that he is not there, accidentally and that he could get married to Ruku, in repair, damages ...
But Ravi answers to him that another woman waits for him (by thinking of Philomena, of course!)
A little later, Ruku saves in turn Ravi, of the attack of an elephant.
Chased by wild animal, they take refuge at the top of a watchtower, planned for that purpose, for a whole night.
It is in the early hours that the pachyderm goes away.
Regrettably, the wrong languages already make good progress in the village further to this episode, to the point that Ravi has to get married to Ruku, avoid him the dishonor, as well as to his poor father, again.
Thus the preparations for the marriage are thrown ...
From his part, Ravi understands, almost too late, also, that the person that he conversed regularly by the telephone, was not other than its Philomena, thanks to words which she, only, usually pronounced: "... Oru Bhagavad Gita-laiyo, oru Quran-laiyo, oru Bible-laiyo, ippadithan oru sambavam nadakanuna adhu maaththu yaaraalum mudiyathu!
He warns immediately David who quite returned it, upset.
But Ravi is always anxious to get married to Ruku, but without the presence of Philomena (who was invited at the request of David, before the rich man knows about all the affair).
Regrettably, Ruku who was there, hears everything.
And David who had to prevent Philomena from attending the marriage, is already heading for Kargudi, his plane lands in a few hours.
In the car which returns her instead of the ceremony, she finds on the seat a file, forgotten the day before, by Ravi.
She understands while the bridegroom is other than his Ravi.
Terrified, she asks to the driver to accelerate so that he arrives in time, so that she can prevent this union between Ravi and Ruku.
Once there, it is with surprise that she notices that Ravi waited for her.
Indeed, Ruku decided otherwise and decided by mutual agreement, to get married, with the man who left quite behind him, for her, by love, Sekhar.
Whereas now married, also, for ever, Ravi and Philomena savors every second of their common existence...

One of the officers present during the Combatant Status Review Tribunals convened at the Guantanamo Bay detention camps, in Cuba, was known as the Recorder.
The structure of the Tribunals loosely resembled the Tribunals described in Army Regulation 190-8, with the key difference that AR-190-8 Tribunals used the definition of "combatant" consistent with that in the Geneva Conventions, while the a much broader definition of "enemy combatant" was used at Guantanamo.
As in the AR-190-8 Tribunals a panel of three officers were authorized to make a determination whether or not an individual had been properly classified as a combatant.
An additional officer was charged with the responsibility of assembling the evidence the three officers would use in making their determination, and with the responsibility to present that information to the three officers.
For the CSR Tribunals that officer was known as the "Recorder", and was always a military lawyer.
CSR Tribunals added a fifth officer, the Personal Representative, whose responsibility was to meet with the captive, try to explain the CSR Tribunal process to them, learn their account of themselves, and present their account to the Tribunal if the captive chose not to attend, or proved unable to present their account themselves.
In the AR-190-8 Tribunal only the President was required to be a field grade officer.
As they were conducted all the officers sitting on the CSR Tribunals were field grade officers.
Komrij's Patentwekker ("Komrij's patented alarm clock") is a book of humorous poetry by Dutch author Gerrit Komrij, first published in 1974.
The book contains four poems which outline a fictional invention—an alarm clock that consists of a burning candle inserted in the sleeper's anus, containing markings for each hour to be spent sleeping.
The deeper the candle is inserted, the earlier the sleeper rises; the inventor acquires a patent on his idea.
They have three quatrains each, rhyming "a b a b" in pentametric lines.
The poems are inspired by a suggestion in "Non Olet" by Collofino (ps.
They were first published (apparently without the author's permission) in a series called "Amsterdamse Cahiers" by Amsterdam printer and publisher C.J. Aarts, supposedly on the occasion of the 1974 edition of Poetry International, an annual Dutch poetry festival.
He later republished the poems (with the author's permission) in 1982.
They were included in Komrij's anthology "Alle gedichten tot gisteren" ("All the poems until yesterday").
In 2007, the poems were again republished separately, with 12 black and white illustrations by Dick Matena.
In 1996, 22 years after its first publication, Komrij's reading of it in Tilburg in 1996 at the annual Night of the Book festival was particularly well received.
The poem fits in a tradition of scatological and rectal poems, many of which were collected by Komrij in his "Komrij's Cacaphonia: An Encyclopedia of Shit" (2006).
The poem is often associated with Komrij, and it is one of the most popular "light" Dutch poems.

The Death of Ivan the Terrible  is a historical drama by Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy written in 1863 and first published in the January 1866 issue of "Otechestvennye zapiski" magazine.
It is the first part of a trilogy that is followed by "Tsar Fiodor Ioannovich" and concludes with "Tsar Boris".
All three plays were banned by the censor.
It dramatises the story of Ivan IV of Russia and is written in blank verse.
Tolstoy was influenced by the work of William Shakespeare in writing the trilogy, which formed the core of his reputation as a writer in the Russia of his day and as a dramatist to this day.
In the early 1863 Aleksey Tolstoy informed Yakov Polonsky in a letter from Dresden that he was working upon "a large poem in verse "The Death of Ioann Grozny"… Two acts of it are being finished and, as people tell me, are good", he added.
The deterioration of health hindered the creative process, but Act 3 has been completed by the summer of that year and in the end of 1863 the play was virtually ready.
Some details as to the original draft of it have been traced through Tolstoy's correspondence with Karolina Pavlova who was translating the text into German, and was being asked to make changes according to those Tolstoy was making to his original text.
Some of the scenes that have been excluded by the author from the final version of the play looked significant, one being Boris Godunov's conversation with tsarina Anastasia Romanovna about her granting him trusteeship right over Dmitry after Ioann and Fyodor's respective deaths.
Also cut has been the scene of Godunov's talk with Dmitry's nanny.
Both, according to Tolstoy, precipitated "Tsar Fiodor Ioannovich", the second play of the trilogy and both have made their way into it later, although, as critics noticed, some fragments of which exactly the same could be said, have been kept in the original text.
Making preparations for the first separate edition of the play, which came in November, 1866, Tolstoy again made changes.
The final Zakharyin's words ("Forgive us all!
Here's the price we have to pay for "edinovlastye", for our own corruption") also appeared for the first time in the book version, summing up what was obviously the drama’s main idea.
Tolstoy was taking into account other people’s opinions he was becoming aware of.
In the Act 5 he dropped some archaisms and also several of the skomorokhs’ couplets, so as to avoid the unwanted comic effect.
The major source for Tolstoy as he was working upon the drama (as it was with the whole trilogy) was "History of the Russian State" by Nikolay Karamzin.
The whole of the Act 1 is based upon one small fragment in Vol.IX of it describing Ioann's feelings after the killing of his son, his relinquishing the throne, boyars' reaction to this and his consent to (as he put it) "bear this burden of rule for some more time" Details of this fragment of "History" have been expanded by Tolstoy into full-blown scenes: Zakharyev addressing boyars, Ioann's musing on the possibility of taking a schema oath, his conversation with boyars.
The messengerэs tale in the Scene 2, Act 1 was based upon Karamzin's description of the Pskov siege which Tolstoy has taken numerous details from, moving them together, chronologically.
The Garaburda scene (exceptionally important for the play's structure, according to the author's "Production plan") has been totally made up, but again, some details involved have been taken from Karamzin (Mikhail Garaburda's negotiations with Grozny in 1573, among others).
Apart from Karamzin's "History" Tolstoy used, albeit to a lesser extent, "Tales of Prince Kurbsky", published in 1831 by N.Ustryalov.
Kurbsky's letters in Scene 2, Act 1, present a mosaic of his real letters, the 1679 one featuring most prominently.
In the Act 4 the Ivan Grozny synodic text reading quotes a real document.
One notable exception is a Pskovian messenger, a figure featuring in historical chronicles.
According to Tolstoy, the action of drama takes place in 1584, the year of Ioann's death.
Yet, Ivan's murdering his son, the abdication, the siege of Pskov, the fire in Aleksandrovskaya sloboda all relate to the second half of 1581.
Tolstoy was improvising a lot when it came to motives and undercurrents, occasionally creating links between things historians thought were unrelated.
Having greatly increased the historical role of Boris Godunov, he's made him take part in several events had no bearing to.
According to I.Yampolsky, Boris' speech in Duma, the clash with Sitsky, addressing Tsar Ivan on behalf of Duma asking for his return to the throne, his opposition to the monarch's marrying Princess of Hastings and unwilling support for tsarina Maria, Ivan's advise for Fyodor to always listen to what Boris would say, - were all author's artistic inventions.
The idea of expanding it into a trilogy came to Tolstoy while he was working on Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich, but, as I.Yampolsky notes, "The Death of Ioann the Terrible" gives the impression some future development of Godunov's character already having been on author’s mind.
The appearance of Mikhail Bityagovsky in the play, the figure which according to historical sources would come upon the scene many years later, could be seen as pointing to this, too.
Besides, Tolstoy created new logical threads between Bityagovsky's taking part in the conflict between Boris and boyars, his agitation of people against Shuisky and Belsky - to the murder of Dmitry.
"The Death of Ivan the Terrible" was first performed at the Alexandrinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg in 1867.
It was not a success, due to the lead role having been given to a comic actor.
The world-famous Moscow Art Theatre began its second season with a production of the play, which opened on 29 September 1899.
It was directed by the seminal theatre practitioner Constantin Stanislavski, who also played the lead role initially.
When Stanislavski fell ill after the first few performances, he was replaced by Vsevolod Meyerhold.
The play received its first New York production in 1904, which opened on 1 March at the New Amsterdam Theatre on Broadway in a translation by S. R. DeMeissner.
He was born on 29 July 1905 and educated at St Olave's Grammar School and the St Catharine's College, Cambridge.
Ordained in 1929 he began his career with a curacy at Holy Trinity, Leicester, after which he was Vice-Principal of Bishop Wilson College, Isle of Man.
From 1951 to 1966 he was Provost of Chelmsford Cathedral and Rector of Chelmsford when he was ordained to the episcopate as the Bishop of Sodor and Man, a post he held for eight years.
In 1974 he retired to Eynsham in Oxfordshire.
He died on 6 June 1992.

"Blackfella/Whitefella" is an Australian country rock song written by Neil Murray and George Rrurrambu, recorded by their Aboriginal rock group, Warumpi Band, and released as the sole single from their 1985 album, "Big Name, No Blankets" on Parole Records and Powderworks Records.
While not a chart success, the song drew attention to issues of racism in Australia through lyrics that encourage harmony and co-operation by people of all races.
The song received national airplay and attention in 1986 when politically charged rockers and Powderworks Records founders Midnight Oil accompanied the band on a free concert tour of remote Aboriginal communities as the Blackfella/Whitefella Tour.
Songwriter Neil Murray's inspiration for "Blackfella/Whitefella" came from his experience as a white man working in Papunya, a predominately Indigenous community north west of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory from 1980.
Although he was part of a minority, Murray found that in the isolated community, everybody was getting along, enjoying activities such as music and football.
In 1985, after discussing the song and its message with band mates Sammy Butcher and George Rrurrambu, the later suggested that Murray include "yellafella" (a term sometimes used to refer to individuals of mixed race) in the lyrics, broadening the message of the song to include people from all places.
In 1985 "Blackfella/Whitefella" appeared as the second track on Warumpi Band's debut album, "Big Name, No Blankets" on Parole Records and Powderworks Records.
The single was included as an addition track on Australian and International 12" single releases of Midnight Oil's "The Dead Heart" released in July 1986.
A 30-minute documentary film entitled "Blackfella/Whitefella" produced by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation was released in 1987.
The film inspired by the song showcases both Warumpi Band and Midnight Oil while touring together through Central Australia in 1986 and deals with both music and politics.
In 2012, a children's book of the same name containing the song's lyrics accompanied by illustrations by Australian children was published by One Day Hill.
"Blackfella Whitefella" is part of a series containing the lyrics of iconic songs which are intended to educate children on the history of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and their struggle for recognition and equal rights.
The book was launched by musician Archie Roach, with a percentage of book sales intended to support the Papunya community.
The Dull Knife Battlefield is located on the eastern slope of the Bighorn Mountains in Johnson County, Wyoming near Kaycee.
It was the scene of the Dull Knife Fight on November 25, 1876, in which the Fourth Cavalry under General Ranald S. Mackenzie raided the winter encampment of the NorthernCheyenne, destroying most of their material culture and all their winter supplies and thus forcing the Northern Cheyenne to seek shelter with the village of Crazy Horse in order to survive the winter.
Five hundred ponies were captured and about 173 lodges destroyed.
The Dull Knife battlefield is on private land and is available to visit only by special arrangement.
The fight took place on November 25, 1876.
The battlefield site was considered by the Cheyenne to be sufficiently remote to be safe as winter quarters.
The site was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.
The project was announced by Emaar Properties on 23 April 2008, with opening proposed for the end of 2009.
The line is being built in three phases which will eventually form a 7 km loop around Downtown Dubai.
Phase 1 opened in 2015.
It runs in the median of the orbital Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Boulevard, with three stops serving The Address and the Manzil Downtown and Vida Downtown hotels.
Phase 1 was originally planned to be a double track express link shuttle service line operating between the Burj place interchange station with Dubai Metro and The Dubai Mall operational by end of 2009, but was put on hold in July 2010.
Phase 2 will include the full loop, providing a single track, mono-directional clockwise commuter service operating to and from the Burj Place interchange station with Dubai Metro.
It is expected to serve all ten stations in the network's development.
Opening was originally planned for 2010.
The heritage-style open-top double-decker trams built in the USA by TIG/m are powered by fuel cells, with batteries used to recover regenerated braking energy.

Dunwoody Village is a non-profit Continuing Care Retirement Community located in Newtown Square, a western suburb of Philadelphia.
The community is built on the grounds of an campus that has a rich history of family ownership which reaches back to the time of the American Revolution.
The community is named for William Hood Dunwoody.
It sits on land which his father James Dunwoody bought from his father-in-law, William Hood.
Both the Hood and Dunwoody families had emigrated from England in the latter part of the 17th century.
As a farm boy in the 1840s, William Dunwoody attended school at the Hood Octagonal School which still stands on the property.
After his schooling, Dunwoody learned to be a broker and dealer in grain from his uncle and by age 23 he formed the flour firm of Dunwoody & Robertson.
In his childhood, Dunwoody had been sickly and, at the age of 28, he took his physician’s advice by moving to Minnesota where he could remain active in the grain business.
He joined Washburn-Crosby Co. in Minneapolis, a prominent milling firm that produced the highly successful Gold Medal Flour.
With them, Dunwoody pioneered overseas spring wheat sales and became a silent partner.
After Dunwoody’s death, the company changed its commercial name to General Mills.
Dunwoody spent the rest of his life in Minnesota, returning to Pennsylvania annually in order to visit his parents and siblings.
Although the family farm had been subdivided after his parents’ death, William used a part of his immense wealth to reconsolidate it for the purpose of establishing a charitable home in memory of his parents.
Dunwoody died in 1914, leaving a $1 million bequest to build a home in which sick or injured workers could recuperate until able to return to the workforce.
In 1924, the Dunwoody Home opened its doors to needy men and operated with a trust fund that continues to this day caring for those in need.
By the late 1960s, recuperative care had been transformed by visiting nurses, hospital sponsored outpatient care, and homes with extensive infirmaries.
As there was no longer a pressing societal need for the services of the Dunwoody Home, utilization declined and the facilities became outdated.
On the other hand, the concept of a non-profit retirement community was evolving as a viable enterprise.
The trustees of the Home sought and obtained court permission to establish a retirement village with continuing care.
The trustees would oversee both the Home and the Village but the two would be separate financially and operationally.
Thus Dunwoody Village came into being with its first residents arriving in late 1974.
This was early in the age of retirement villages as we know them today.
As a result, the design of Dunwoody Village embraced some unique construction features seldom seen in subsequent retirement community designs.
These include heated hallways connecting all parts of the complex, atria with natural light and growing plants spread throughout the complex, and cinder block walls to isolate noise and prevent the spread of fire.
An operating feature quite uncommon within continuing care communities elsewhere was United States postal delivery to each apartment door.
Not only was there a mixture of studio, one bedroom, and two bedroom apartments, there were apartment suites located at ground level.
Many communities developed at a later time offered villas, but these were free standing structures that involved some degree of exposure to the weather for residents to reach the core facility.
Dunwoody Village opened with skilled nursing and personal care facilities.
Over the years, some of the notable improvements have been establishment of a long-term nursing pavilion, upgrading all double occupancy nursing rooms to single occupancy, and the means to provide special care for dementia patients.
The headwaters of Hunter Run rise on the grounds of Dunwoody Village.
A large barn for farm animals built in 1924 to support the Dunwoody Home still stands.
Unusual in having a glazed brick silo for fodder storage, this landmark gives a visual link to the historic nature of the property.
The Hood Octagonal School building occupies a prominent position on the grounds.
Once thought to date back to 1798, thorough research revealed that it was erected in 1842 and the schoolhouse was entered on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.
The Dunwoody Home itself outlived its ability to provide charitable care both financially and structurally.
The few remaining residents were accommodated charitably in Dunwoody Village.
Miller was born and raised in Portage la Prairie.
He articled in the law firm of Meighen and Sexsmith, the law firm founded by future Prime Minister Arthur Meighen.
Miller was called to the bar in 1920 and practiced law in Portage la Prairie and was respected in his field, being elected a bencher of the Law Society of Manitoba.
He was active with the Conservative Party of Manitoba serving as president of the provincial association.
In 1946, he was elected in a by-election to the House of Commons of Canada as the Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament for Portage la Prairie following the death of Harry Leader.
His riding was abolished due to redistribution and Miller did not run in another electoral district in the 1949 federal election and instead retired from politics and returned to his law practice until 1959 when he was named to the Court of Queen's Bench of Manitoba.
In 1960, he was appointed to Manitoba's Court of Appeal and in 1961 he was named Chief Justice of Manitoba.
He retired from the bench in 1967.

Shattered Trust: The Shari Karney Story is a 1993 American made-for-television drama film directed by Bill Corcoran.
The film, which is based upon the true story of Shari Karney, garnered generally positive reviews.
However, it was criticized for exploiting a real incest case for entertainment use.
Situated in the early 1980s, Shari Karney is a successful attorney, assigned to an incest case, involving a three-year-old girl, Christie, who is being molested by her father.
She initially refuses to take the case, explaining that she isn't familiar with cases involving sexual abuse.
She is later convinced by the child's mother, Darlene Holland, but the trial proves to be difficult.
Nine months later, she is heavily invested in the case, which involves her private life.
She has trouble sleeping at night and is often bothered by flashbacks of her own past.
Whenever she tries to make love with her boyfriend Mark, she suffers panic attacks.
She eventually attacks David Holland, the man charged, in the courtroom and is therefore sent to jail for two days.
Shari fears she has ruined the case, but Darlene insists on holding her as her lawyer.
The judge, however, puts her on probation and forces her to seek psychological help.
She contacts psychiatrist Joan Delvecchio and admits to her that she is constantly hearing typing sounds.
She reveals that as a child she was physically abused by her mother, and that her father had done nothing to protect her.
Her sister Linda thinks therapy would be good for her, explaining that there must be a reason that she never wore make-up and always wore baggy clothes.
At court, David is prohibited from seeing his daughter for six months.
Shari is furious that thereafter, he is allowed to see her again, claiming that he then will keep on raping her.
Meanwhile, in therapy, Joan notices that Shari shows the same symptoms as rape victims, but thinks it could be explained by her fathers's abuse.
When Mark finds out she has taken another incest case, he leaves her.
She turns to her parents, but her mother blames her for having driven Mark away.
Her therapist makes her write a letter to her mother.
When writing, not only does she express the hatred she feels for her mother, but also reveals that she is an incest victim herself, having been abused by her father for years.
She starts to remember everything and finds out that she buried the abuse so deep that she didn't consciously remember it.
In sessions, Joan helps her remember the entire truth and eventually Shari tells that her father raped her after typing, which explains the sounds of typing she heard.
She confronts her parents, but they respond with outrage, claiming they will never forgive her for the accusation.
Linda refuses to believe her as well and has trouble even accepting the possibility.
At work, her new client withdraws and Christie is hospitalized.
Frustrated, she is determined to change the law, allowing incest victims to sue their parents whenever they want to, without a statute of limitations.
She contacts Stephanie Chadford, another lawyer who tried to change the incest law.
This requires her to step to the media, telling her own story.
She is immediately estranged from her sister and disowned by her parents.
Meanwhile, the process of changing a law proves to be exhausting, taking up to six years to even qualify in court, and her emotional involvement upsets her partners, who eventually fire her.
In the end, however, the law changes, with Shari's help.
Parts of the film were shot in Salt Lake City, Utah.
It was a splinter group of nine Cumann na nGaedheal TDs led by Joseph McGrath, who had been Minister for Industry and Commerce in the Cumann na nGaedheal government.
McGrath founded the National Party in the aftermath of the Army Mutiny, the last military challenge to civilian authority in Ireland.
The nine TDs protested the refusal of the government to reinstate mutineers among the officer corps in October 1924.
The nine resigned their seats to run in simultaneous by-elections in March 1925, described as a "mini-general election", as a test of public opinion and sympathy with the mutiny.
Seven of the polls were won by Cumann na nGaedheal; the other two were won by the abstentionist candidates of Sinn Féin, then led by Éamon de Valera.
Sunkist is a brand of primarily orange flavored soft drinks launched in 1979.
Sunkist was first licensed by Sunkist Growers to the General Cinema Corporation, the leading independent bottler of Pepsi-Cola products at the time.
The soft drink was the idea of Mark Stevens, who foresaw the potential based on market research which indicated that, worldwide, orange was the third best selling soft drink flavor (largely due to The Coca-Cola Company's Fanta brand).
After extensive R&D during 1977 and early 1978, in which research was conducted on taste, color and carbonation levels, Sunkist made a grand introduction in New York by franchising it to The Coca-Cola Bottling Company of New York City, where Edward F. O'Reilly was president.
It went national soon thereafter by being franchised mainly to leading Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola bottlers.
The advertising slogan was "fun, sun and the beach" using TV and radio commercials with the Beach Boys' hit song "Good Vibrations" as the brand's theme.
In 1980, Sunkist Orange Soda became the #1 orange soda in the USA and the 10th best selling soft drink.
Unlike many other competing orange sodas, Sunkist contains caffeine (41.0mg).
In 2010, there was a consumer recall after a batch was accidentally mixed with 6 times amount of the caffeine, sickening consumers.
In late 1984, Sunkist Soft Drinks was sold to Del Monte.
From late 1986 until 2008, it was produced by Cadbury Schweppes under license through its Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages subsidiary.
Following the demerger of Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages from Cadbury Schweppes, it is now produced by Keurig Dr Pepper in the USA.
Sunkist (as a carbonated soft drink) is sold in the UK by Vimto Soft Drinks under license from Sunkist Growers.
It is also sold in Australia by Schweppes Australia (a subsidiary of Asahi Breweries), but the Australian formulation is caffeine free.
In Canada, a caffeine free version of the orange drink is marketed as C'Plus.
The package indicates that there is a small amount of Sunkist Juice.
In the Philippines, it was sold by Cosmos Bottling until 2001, when San Miguel Corporation acquired Cosmos and sold its brands to Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc.
As of 2013, Sunkist is sold by Asia Brewery.
Keurig Dr Pepper makes a variety of Sunkist flavors.
The Ethiopia Commodity Exchange (ECX) is a commodities exchange established April 2008 in Ethiopia.
In Proclamation 2007-550, which created the ECX, its stated objective was "to ensure the development of an efficient modern trading system" that would "protect the rights and benefits of sellers, buyers, intermediaries, and the general public."
The ECX is set up as a private company owned by a partnership of the market actors, members of the exchange, and the Ethiopian government, led by Eleni Gebre Medhin a former economist for the International Food Policy Research Institute and the World Bank.
As of July 2011, the physical presence of the ECX consists of 55 warehouses in 17 regional locations.
It has grown from trading 138,000 tons in its first year to 508,000 tons in its third year, with nearly equal shares of coffee and oilseeds and pulses.
The value of the ECX rose 368% between 2010 and 2011 to reach US$1.1 billion.
As of November 2010, the trading floor in Addis Ababa handled 200 spot contracts in commodities such as coffee, sesame, navy beans, maize and wheat.
It was assessed in July 2011 that membership equaled 243 with clients, who trade through members, about 7,800.
Farmer cooperatives represented 2.4 millions smallholder farmers, which make up 12% of the membership.
Currently, the ECX is the only stock or commodity exchange in Africa to have streamlined payment transfers down to "T+1" (ext day payment after a trade) from its clearinghouse to its partner commercial banks.
"Push" price date is transmitted in real time to outdoor electronic ticker boards in 32 rural sites, the ECX website, 256,000 mobile subscribers via instant messaging, the radio, TV and print media.
"Pull" market data is available through a toll-free phone-in service.
The service received more than 1 million calls in September 2011, 70% coming from rural callers.
The first year of the Ethiopia Commodity Exchange's existence is documented in the PBS Wide Angle film "The Market Maker".

The house was built in 1890 by early Redlands residents David and Sarah Morey for $20,000, profits from the sale of their citrus nursery.
Following the Moreys' deaths in 1901, the house's second owners were Willard R. and Nancy Cheney, the brother and sister-in-law of Helen Cheney Kimberly, who was the wife of one of the founders of Kimberly-Clark Corporation.
In the 1940s, it was reportedly owned by actress Carole Lombard's uncle and left to her in his will, but she died before she could take ownership.
Shortly after, the mansion was purchased by Willard M. and Florence Wiseman, and then sold in 1969 to Curtiss and Phyllis Allen.
The Allens owned it during the 1970s.
Mr. Allen had seen the house as a young boy while in Redlands; he told someone that he was going to own that house one day.
A friend told him it was for sale and Mr. Allen purchased it immediately.
The house was featured in the film "Talk About a Stranger" (1952) as the house of the character Dr. Paul Mahler, alias Matlock.
The mansion opened as the first bed and breakfast in Redlands in 1985 under then-owners Carl Ljungquist and Gary Conway.
The house was purchased by Janet Cosgrove in 1998, who oversaw renovation work to the building before reopening it as a bed and breakfast in 2006.
In 2010, Sara and Bill Taylor bought the mansion for sole use as their private residence.
In 2012 the house went into foreclosure.
In January 2014, ownership was returned to Janet Cosgrove.

Continuous revelation or continuing revelation is a theological belief or position that God continues to reveal divine principles or commandments to humanity.
In Christian traditions, it is most commonly associated with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), and with Pentecostal and Charismatic Christianity, though it is found in some other denominations as well.
Continuous revelation also forms part of the rituals of gatherings in various chapters of Taoism.
A notable factor of continuous or continuing revelation as a source of divine commandments and statements is the written recording of such statements in a more open scriptural canon, as is the case with the Latter-Day Saints; while more frequent with the Latter-Day Saints, it is less frequent with the Baha'i Faith, with progressive revelation only being periodically expanded over an extremely long period.
Conservative Judaism teaches God's revelation at Mount Sinai and God's continuing revelation through study of Jewish texts and through life as a Jewish believer.
Vatican II states “no new public revelation is to be expected before the glorious manifestation of our Lord, Jesus Christ.”
The notion of progressive or continuing revelation is not held by the Roman Catholic Church or by Eastern Orthodoxy, who instead favor the idea of tradition and development of doctrine, while progressivist and continuationist approaches are specifically condemned in the declaration Dominus Iesus.
Protestants generally teach that the modern age is not a period of continuing revelation.
The Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) affirm continuing revelation through the Inner light or the light within, which is the presence of God which provides illumination and guidance to the individual and through individuals to the group.
Some Friends consider the Bible the ultimate authority, but others consider the Inner Light to be above the Bible.
Both groups believe that the Inner Light speaks to people directly and not just through the text of the Bible.
Because Friends believe that revelation is ongoing, they have no set creed or dogmas.
However, as early Friends listened to the Inner light and endeavored to live accordingly, a common set of beliefs gradually emerged, which became known as testimonies.
Although rooted in the immediate experience of the community of Friends, these Testimonies are based on what Friends believe are verified in the Bible, especially as described in the Gospels regarding the life and teachings of Jesus.
Pentecostal and Charismatic Christians generally believe that Christians, especially "Spirit-filled" Christians can receive revelations from God in the form of dreams, visions, and audible or inaudible voices.
They also believe that certain individuals are able to transmit revelations from God in the form of prophecy, words of knowledge, and speaking in tongues and interpretation of tongues.
While most Pentecostals and Charismatics believe the Bible to be the ultimate authority and would not say that any new revelation can ever contradict the Bible, they do believe that God continues to speak to people today on extra-biblical topics as well as to interpret and apply the text of the Bible.
Mormonism makes a distinction between personal revelation and revelation directed to all members of the church.
They believe that personal revelation can come to any individual with a righteous desire, for example to direct someone in their search for truth.
In contrast, revelation for the entire church only comes to those who have been called by God as prophets, which in the LDS Church includes the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.
Mormons regard revelation through prophets as an indispensable element of Christ's church, without which the church would be led by man, not God.
Continued revelation is essential for matters affecting the church as a whole, including guiding the church through changing world conditions, keeping doctrine pure and unadulterated, revealing new doctrine and scripture in the times appointed by God, and making policy or organizational changes as the church grows and evolves.
In contrast to the Mainstream Christian belief that God has "sealed up the heavens" in terms of church-wide revelation, Mormons believe God continues to follow the pattern that he adhered to throughout the entire span of the Bible, which was to reveal his will and doctrine through prophets.
Mormons see the tendency to dismiss the possibility that God could call modern prophets as similar to the attitude of those in the Bible who rejected the prophets and/or apostles of their day.
As demonstrated by the Jews in the time of Jesus, it is often much less challenging to accept prophets of prior ages, rather than a contemporary prophet.
Granted, the work of a prophet has always been to dispel false beliefs and warn against behaviors that are contrary to God's will, which inevitably creates friction when viewed as a threat to firmly entrenched traditions and mindsets.
The sense of change in the message of Christ and the apostles led many to regard them as false prophets.
Christ himself warned against false prophets, teaching that the way to distinguish between a true and a false prophet was "by their fruits" (Matt 7:15-20); however, the perceived threat to tradition was often a strong enough deterrent to cause the witnesses of good fruits (such as powerful sermons or miraculous healings) to dismiss them as the work of the devil (Matt 12:24).
After Christ ordained his apostles, he warned them of the extreme opposition they would encounter for these reasons, telling them, "ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake" (Matt 10:16-23).
Christ also said, “Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you!
For so did their fathers to the false prophets," thus illustrating that opposition will naturally accompany a true prophet if they are doing their job correctly (Luke 6:22-26).
Sometimes the opposition against God's prophets escalated to the point of violence and martyrdom, which Jesus and the apostles frequently referenced while preaching to their detractors (Matt 23:31-37, Luke 11:47-51, Acts 7:52, Romans 11:3, 1 Thes 2:15).
In this sense, Mormons acknowledge that revelation has not continued uninterrupted throughout history, being that the killing of God's prophets sometimes resulted in periods without church-wide revelation—which Mormons refer to as apostasies.
Similar to prophets before them, Peter and the apostles also suffered martyrdom at the hands of their persecutors—with the exception of John who was banished to the Isle of Patmos.
In contrast to the Mainstream Christian view that the apostolic era came to a close because revelation had reached its completion, Mormons see it not as God's will but as a tragic result of the overwhelming persecution that plagued the church in that era, which cut short the program of apostolic succession that had commenced when Judas was replaced by Matthias (Acts 1:23-26).
The apostasy that followed is referred to as the Great Apostasy, because it lasted longer than prior periods without prophets.
Mormons believe that once the Christian church was no longer led by revelation, its doctrine began to be altered by theologians who took it upon themselves to continue developing doctrine, despite not being called or authorized to receive revelation for the church body.
In the absence of revelation, these theologians often resorted to speculation, which coupled with their own interpretations and extrapolations of scripture, inevitably resulted in disagreement and division on many doctrinal points.
Ecumenical councils were held in order to settle these differences, yet without prophets called and authorized to reveal God's will on the topics being debated, the attendees could only vote on the theories presented in order to decide which ones would become official doctrine—a practice that served to ostracize as heretics those who didn't go along with these decisions, and in some cases led to major schisms in the church.
Mormons view this process of doctrinal development as completely foreign to God's established pattern of revealing doctrine through a prophet.
They point to history as incontrovertible proof that humans are incapable of agreeing on how to interpret the Bible (2 Pet 1:20), which should act as a strong indicator that God's purpose for the Bible was not to derive doctrine, but rather to support it.
When doctrine is not established and maintained through continued revelation, Mormons see the inevitable result as “philosophies of man, mingled with scripture”.
Mormons again point to the Bible to show that after every period of apostasy, God always eventually called another prophet when the time was right.
It is in that same spirit that Mormons claim that once conditions were ready, God again resumed his pattern of revealing his will through prophets by calling Joseph Smith, through whom he restored the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, clearing up the error that had been introduced during the Great Apostasy.
Mormons believe that since that time, revelation through prophets and apostles has continued unbroken until the present day, God having promised that revelation will not be taken again from the earth before the Second Coming of Christ.
The Community of Christ (Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints), the second largest Latter Day Saint denomination, regularly canonizes revelation into the Doctrine and Covenants.
If the conference confirms the Words of Counsel as prophetic, it is added as a Section in the scripture known as Doctrine and Covenants.
Ahmadi Muslims believe that while law-bearing revelation has ended with the perfection of scripture in the form of the Qur'an, non-scriptural revelation to non-prophets as well as non law-bearing Muslim prophets continues.
They cite Qur'anic verses as well as Ahadith considered by many to be authentic in support of their belief in continuous revelation.
Progressive revelation is a core teaching in the Bahá'í Faith that suggests that religious truth is revealed by God progressively and cyclically over time through a series of divine Messengers, and that the teachings are tailored to suit the needs of the time and place of their appearance.
Thus, the Bahá'í teachings recognize the divine origin of several world religions as different stages of in the history of one religion, while believing that the revelation of Bahá'u'lláh is the most recent (though not the last—that there will never be a last), and therefore the most relevant to modern society.
Bahá'ís believe God to be generally regular and periodic in revealing His will to mankind through messengers/prophets, which are named Manifestations of God.
Each messenger in turn establishes a covenant and founds a religion.
This process of revelation, according to the Bahá'í writings, is also never ceasing.
The general theme of the successive and continuous religions founded by Manifestations of God is that there is an evolutionary tendency, and that each Manifestation of God brings a larger measure of revelation (or religion) to humankind than the previous one.
The differences in the revelation brought by the Manifestations of God is stated to be not inherent in the characteristics of the Manifestation of God, but instead attributed to the various worldly, societal and human factors; these differences are in accordance with the "conditions" and "varying requirements of the age" and the "spiritual capacity" of humanity.
Thus religious truth is seen to be relative to its recipients and not absolute; while the messengers proclaimed eternal moral and spiritual truths that are renewed by each messenger, they also changed their message to reflect the particular spiritual and material evolution of humanity at the time of the appearance of the messenger.
In the Bahá'í view, since humanity's spiritual capacity and receptivity has increased over time, the extant to which these spiritual truths are expounded changes.
In various designated offshoots of Taoism like the De Schools in Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong, and the Dao Schools in Hong Kong, Taiwan and China, weekly or sometimes monthly gatherings are held at temples to receive and understand communications from above by way of two mediums holding rattan sifts writing on sand, who are 'dictated' with news ranging in contents from current affairs, religion, to arts and morality, the writings are called Sift Text or '乩文'.
Different gods in the Daoist pantheon are designated for temples which have to go through the rigour of acceptance before the contents are recognized as authorized communiques from heaven.
It was renamed in 2003 amid the restructuring of districts and counties in Huizhou.

Qualifying for the 2010 FIBA World Championship in Turkey commenced as early as 2007 and will culminate in the five continental championships in each of the five FIBA zones.
The final ranking of each continental championship determines which teams go to Turkey for the world championship, with FIBA allocating slots partly based on a zone's strength.
In addition to the host, the gold medalists in the 2008 Olympic basketball championship are also allocated automatic berths to the championship.
Teams that failed to crack the top positions in their respective continental championships may still be selected as wild cards to fill out the 24-team cast.
A total of 106 countries participated in qualification to the world championship.
The USA also received an automatic berth for winning the 2008 Olympic Men's Basketball Tournament.
Eighteen other teams qualified through continental qualifying tournaments, and FIBA invited four more "wild card" teams to fill out the 24-team field.
Each FIBA zone is allocated a certain amount of automatic berths based upon the strength of its zone: the weakest zone, Oceania, gets only two automatic berths each, while Europe gets six.
Certain peculiarities include:
Qualifying tournaments:
La Guiannée (or La Guignolée) is celebrated on December 31 (New Year's Eve)
It is a French medieval New Year's Eve tradition that is still practiced in two towns in the United States.
The tradition related to poor people being able to ask the more wealthy for food and drink at the celebrations of winter.
Customarily a troupe of traveling male singers went from door to door to entertain and ring in the new year.
Hosts were expected to give them food and drink.
Other sources say the young men were seeking donations for Twelfth Night.
Begun as a way for the poor to be given gratuities by the rich, it also became a community social event for young men to visit with the families of young women.
Over time, the practice became an occasion for visiting with relatives and friends and was more or less a traveling feast.
At first it was carried on only by young men, often in costume; women joined the party in the 20th century.
In many years, the people appeared in disguise, as part of the celebration was a kind of overturning of the common order.
This tradition has been practiced annually since 1722 in Prairie du Rocher, Illinois.
It has been revived in Ste. Genevieve, Missouri.
Both were former French colonial villages settled by French Canadians in the eighteenth century.
In the latter town, current celebrations feature singers and musicians, attired in colonial dress, who begin their night's journey at the local American Legion Hall.
They make their way through all the restaurants, bars, nursing homes and high school gyms, ending at midnight at the Knights of Columbus Hall.

A bone marrow drive was attempted to no avail.
After defeating nine 2nd degree blackbelts in succession at the Kodokan, he received a special promotion to 3rd degree black belt.
He also began studying Shorinji Kempo and several styles of karate including wado ryu, and shito-ryu.
In 1959, he was a member of the university team winning the team championship.
The following year he graduated Nihon University majoring in business.
Following his childhood dream he went to the United States and began teaching judo at West Point Military Academy.
In 1960 he moved to the United States.

He was also the founding coach of the Judo program at New Jersey Institute of Technology (then known as "Newark College of Engineering") during the mid-60s.
Additionally, he served as an instructor at the Jerome Mackey judo schools.
Yonezuka was twice chosen to serve as head coach of the United States at the Olympics Judo Team, and he coached three U.S. World Judo Championships Teams as well.
Yonezuka believed that the Japanese could not accept that Judo became more like wrestling and less of a martial art.
In 2007 he was awarded the rank of Kudan by the United States Judo Federation (USJF), which is the Ninth Degree black belt in Judo becoming one of only several American residents to be honored with the second highest Judo Degree.
Since 1995 he also held the 8th Degree Black Belt in Judo from the Kodokan Judo Institute in Japan, an 8th Degree Black Belt in Karate, and was a Godan (Fifth Degree) in Sumo.

The men's 200 metre freestyle event at the 2005 Maccabiah Games took place on 11 July at the Wingate Institute.
This swimming event used freestyle swimming, which means that the method of the stroke is not regulated (unlike backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly events).
Nearly all swimmers use the front crawl or a variant of that stroke.
Because an Olympic size swimming pool is 50 metres long, this race consisted of four lengths of the pool.
Prior to this competition, the existing Maccabiah record was as follows.
The following new Maccabiah records were set during this competition.

Paestum Airfield is an abandoned World War II military airfield in Italy, located approximately 9 km north-northeast of Agropoli, in the province of Salerno, in the Campania region of Italy.
It was an all-weather temporary field built by the United States Army Air Force XII Engineer Command using a graded earth compacted surface, with a prefabricated hessian (burlap) surfacing known as PHS.
PHS was made of an asphalt-impregnated jute which was rolled out over the compacted surface over a square mesh track (SMT) grid of wire joined in 3-inch squares.
In addition, tents were used for billeting and also for support facilities; an access road was built to the existing road infrastructure; a dump for supplies, ammunition, and gasoline drums, along with a drinkable water and minimal electrical grid for communications and station lighting.
Once completed it was turned over for use by the Twelfth Air Force 33d Fighter Group which operated P-40 Warhawks from the field between 13 September-18 November 1943, supporting ground forces as they advanced and attacking enemy aircraft on the air and ground.
Later, the 340th Bombardment Group operated B-25 Mitchell medium bombers from the field between 23 March and 14 April 1944.
After the 340th moved out the airfield was dismantled.
Today, there are no remaining traces of the airfield as the area around the town of Paestum are heavily farmed and the agricultural use has obliterated any trace of the airfield.
It is unknown precisely where the airfield was actually located due to the changed landscape over the past 60 years.

Born in The Hague, Netherlands, he was christened James Washington, but officially named Jacobus Washington.
Most of his adult life was shaped by his participation in wars for and against Napoleonic France and his service to Ludwig I of Bavaria.
The known history of the Washington family goes back to the 12th century.
Sir Robert Washington (d. 1324) was the progenitor of the branch of the family residing in Sulgrave Manor, England.
One of his descendants, John Washington, emigrated to Virginia in 1656 and was the great-grandfather of George Washington.
The brother of Sir Robert, Sir John Washington (d. 1331), founded the Hallhead Hall/Adwick-le-street branch of the Washingtons.
His descendant, James Washington, accompanied John Washington to Virginia, but returned to England, then shortly thereafter emigrated to Rotterdam, the Netherlands.
There he married a Dutchwoman named Clara van der Lauen, leading, five generations later, to Jacobus Washington.
On February 2, 1777, Daniel Washington, aged 46 and a military solicitor, married Elisabeth Cornelia Hoogstad.
Jacobus was born on January 26, 1778.
His only sibling, Daniel, was born July 27, 1781.
Their father died in October 1786, and their mother in September 1789, leaving them orphaned at 11 and 8 years old.
Little is known of their lives for some years after.
Daniel remained in the Netherlands, married in 1808, and died in 1813, apparently without children.
In 1794, aged 16, Jacobus Washington joined the Dutch Army.
When the French invaded later that year he fought against them.
In 1799, in a letter to George Washington, Jacobus offered his services to the United States in its undeclared Quasi-War with France, but was turned down due to his inexperience.
He then moved to the Kingdom of Bavaria, where he joined the Bavarian Army.
He came to the attention of Crown Prince Ludwig, who made Jakob his adjutant.
In July 1807 Jakob was present at the negotiations for the Treaties of Tilsit following the victory of the French Empire (of which Bavaria was now an ally) over Russia.
Over the next few years he advanced to the rank of Colonel.
In October 1813, Bavaria joined the Allies against France.
On June 7, 1815 in Brussels, Jakob Washington signed a treaty with the Duke of Wellington representing Bavaria.
He fought in the Battle of Waterloo, the only Bavarian officer to do so, since the rest of the Bavarians were held in reserve in Saarbrücken.
In 1825, Ludwig became King of Bavaria as Ludwig I. Washington's career continued apace, rising eventually to Lieutenant General.
Ludwig also appointed him Grand Chamberlain and Marshal of his military household.
In 1843, on a visit to London, Queen Victoria dubbed him a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath.
Jakob's first wife was baroness Antonie van Löchner (born Baroness von Verger) (1788–1830), a wealthy widow.
After her death, he married baroness Caroline Segesser von Brunegg (1802–1841) in 1833.
Through this marriage he gained the Castle Notzing, near the town of Erding, Bavaria.
Baron Jakob von Washington died in Notzing on April 5, 1848.
Maximilian Emanuel also became Grand Chamberlain, married Duchess Frederica of Oldenburg (sister of Queen Amalia of Greece), and had two sons, one of whom, named George, served in the 11th Hussars of the Austro-Hungarian army reaching the rank of captain.
However, despite reports to the contrary, he did not fight during the First World War, having retired before the War started.
Both sons died without issue, and since none of Jakob's other children had any offspring, the von Washington line became extinct.

He then attended Central Catholic High School for a few years before leaving to take a scholarship to Shady Side Academy.
He graduated from Shady Side in 1989, earning scholarship offers to several universities.
In 1989, McAllister enrolled at Davidson College, on "the 13-year path to a four-year degree".
He was slated to walk-on the Davidson basketball team as a freshman but declined after coach Bobby Hussey left Davidson after the 1988–1989 school year.
He left school in 1992 for a sabbatical that lasted a decade.
Before leaving that spring, he contributed a piece on Black History Month to the school paper "The Davidsonian", receiving numerous anonymous threats, including isolated death threats.
McAllister dropped out of college for a decade and became a father at age 21 with the first of his two children.
In 2000, McAllister re-enrolled at Davidson College, graduating with a history degree in 2002.
In 2005, McAllister ran for office in Davidson, North Carolina, losing as the only Republican against an all-Democrat slate by only 56 votes.
In 2007, he ran and lost another close race, after McAllister was slated to win one of five seats in non-official polling.
In July 2008, he was featured in a series of commercials on Black Entertainment Television regarding the upcoming election.
Soon after, Fox Charlotte cast him as their political contributor during the 2008 campaign.
McAllister provided live commentary during question-and-answer sessions and live editorials weekly on the "Fox News Rising" morning show, the Charlotte morning show.
McAllister attended the 2008 Republican National Convention representing Hip Hop Republicans, and provided commentary on CNN, Fox Charlotte, XM Radio, and BET, as well as webcasts on Washington Post and Fox.
On CNN American Morning, he gave a critical view of the approach to the Governor Sarah Palin VP introduction to America, saying that her daughter’s pregnancy was an opportunity to make a connection to everyday Americans instead of trying to portray the Palins as perfect.
In March 2013, he ran as a candidate in the Republican primary for Illinois's 2nd congressional district special election, but lost.
McAllister writes for several online magazines and blogs.
He has also been published in the "Charlotte Post", "Newsweek", and "The Dallas Morning News".

In physical rehabilitation and sports training, the SAID principle asserts that the human body adapts specifically to imposed demands.
In other words, given stressors on the human system, whether biomechanical or neurological, there will be a "Specific Adaptation to Imposed Demands" (SAID).
For example, by only doing pull-ups on the same regular pull-up bar, your body becomes adapted to this specific physical demand, but not necessarily adapted to other climbing patterns or environments.
In 1958, Berkeley Professor of Physical Education Franklin M. Henry proposed the "Specificity Hypothesis of Motor Learning".
It is found in eastern North Carolina, Louisiana and Florida.
Adults have been found from April to September in North Carolina, suggesting the species breeds continuously and likely has three or four generations per year.

The school served fifth and sixth graders.
In the spring of 2013, Chapman Intermediate School was closed, as it was no longer needed.
Students who would have attended it now attend one of the four feeder elementary schools until fifth grade, and then attend E.T. Booth Middle School in sixth grade.
Chapman opened in 2000 with approximately 1150 fifth and sixth grade students and a staff of almost 100.
Until 1935, there was a small school located across from Bascomb Church on what is now Bascomb-Carmel Road.
It consisted of grades one through seven.
In 1935, Bascomb School was consolidated with another elementary school and was later torn down.
South Cherokee County remained a rural area into the mid-1960s.
Highway 92 was paved in 1962.
Until that time it had been an all-weather graveled road and was known as the Old Alabama Road.
Around this time, south Cherokee County began growing by leaps and bounds.
People began moving to the area and driving to work in Atlanta.
Rooms and buildings were added, only to be outgrown before they were completed.
The property of the Chapman family was purchased for the new school.
Construction was begun in 1971 and completed in February 1974.
From August 1973 until February 1974, the Chapman faculty and students were split and located at Woodstock and Oak Grove.
The school opened with grades one through eight.
During the 1970s and 1980s, the area continued to grow and E.T. Booth Middle School was built and opened nearby.
The seventh and eighth grade students from Chapman and other south Cherokee elementary schools were transferred to the new middle school.
A large two-story classroom building was added to the Chapman campus in 1990 to accommodate its ever-increasing enrollment.
During the 1998-1999 school year, once again some decisions were needed to make arrangements for the growing schools in the area.
With parent and faculty input, the decision was made to create a school for fifth and sixth grade students and to house this new school at the Chapman campus.
Preparations were made to transition these students from Bascomb, Boston, and Oak Grove Elementaries.
In August 2000, Chapman Intermediate School opened with approximately 1150 fifth and sixth grade students and a staff of almost 100.
In 2011, the building of the new E.T. Booth Middle School began.
This took sixth grade, and the elementary schools took fifth grade.
It is speculated that Chapman will become a ninth grade academy for Etowah High School.
In January 2014, Chapman became Etowah East High School and featured some technology-based classes, such as AP Computer Science.
In the 2014-2015 school year, Chapman's cafeteria opened to students traveling between Etowah High School and Etowah East.
As a result, all trailers at Etowah High were scheduled to be removed from campus at the end of the 2013-2014 school year.
Ewbanks is located along a railroad line northeast of Quincy.

Asterleigh, sometimes in the past called Esterley, is a farm and deserted medieval village about northeast of Charlbury in Oxfordshire.
Asterleigh's toponym indicates that it was created by woodland clearance on what would then have been the edge of Wychwood Forest.
The Domesday Book of 1086 does not record Asterleigh as a separate settlement.
Medieval pottery found in 1948 suggests that Asterleigh was inhabited by the 12th century.
Also in 1948, squared stones were found along with limestone roofing slates that had medieval-style drilled nail-holes.
The earliest known documentary record of Asterleigh is from early in the 13th century.
However, the village declined and its landowning family decided to leave the village and move to Nether Kiddington.
In 1895 it was combined with the civil parish of Kiddington.
Azra Sherwani (1940–2005) was a Pakistani television actress with a career spanning over 35 years who played a variety of roles.
She began her career with the Rawalpindi Studios of PTV in the late 1960s.
Sherwani worked with some of the best producers in the country including Mohsin Ali, late Shereen Khan, late Shahzad Khalil, Sultana Siddiqui, Zaheer Khan and Sahira Kazmi.
She also worked with some of the best writers of her time including Fatima Surraiya Bajiya, Haseena Moin and Anwar Maqsood.
The role of Apa Begum in Haseena Moin's "Tanhaiyaan" was undoubtedly the most famous of her career where Shahzad Khalil cast her as a tough taskmaster who ill-treated her employee, Buqrat, played by Jamshed Ansari.
She logically argued (and winning in the end, of course) with him as to why he should get bus fare when walking can improve his health and solve the problem.
Her character wanted her brother (Qazi Wajid as Faran) to marry a dominant woman which, fortunately, does not happen.
As Ghazi Apa in "Uncle Urfi", she stood between the two love birds, quarrelled regularly with Hasnat Bhai (Jamshed Ansari again) and was the dominant force behind the extremely funny Shaheer Bhai (Qurban Jilani).
Azra played the selfish mother of Sitara (Atiqa Odho) in "Sitara Aur Mehr-un-nisa" and the despised mother-in-law aka Saliha Begum of Mahboob Ahmed (Shakeel) in "Aangan Terha" with Bushra Ansari and Saleem Nasir as Akbar, the live-in Man Friday with a passion for classical dance.
Then she was the villainous Mai Jaina in "Mera Naam Mangu" in the early 1970s — a play about professional beggars — while she excelled in Haseena Moin's "Parchaiyaan" as part of a star cast comprising Rahat Kazmi, Sahira Kazmi, Shakeel and Talat Hussain.
She held her own in Bajiya's "Afshaan", with fellow cast members Shafi Mohammad, Shakeel, Qazi Wajid, Ishrat Hashmi and Begum Khurshid Mirza.
In short, her histrionic talent set the standards for character acting on Pakistan television.
Azra Sherwani worked with actors of all generations — from Qazi Wajid, Subhani Ba Yunus, Imtiaz Ahmed, Begum Khurshid Mirza, Qurban Jilani, Shakeel, Shafi Mohammad, Talat Iqbal, Anwar Maqsood, Akbar Subhan, Behroze Sabzwari, Shahnaz Sheikh, Marina Khan, Ishrat Hashmi, Jamshed Ansari, Babar Ali, Mazhar Ali, Mishi Khan, Atiqa Odho, Sania Saeed, Sajid Hasan and Sadia Imam.
When the advent of private productions brought about the decline of quality plays on PTV, Azra Sherwani sustained for some time, working in plays such as "Kanwal", Bajiya's "Ghar Ik Nagar" and Sultana Siddiqui's "Doosri Duniya".
Her character was such that she quarrels with Qazi Wajid, a tenant in the house of Khala's folks who refuses to either leave or pay the rent.
Qazi Wajid, who worked with her the most from 1970s to 2000, said she was a sincere actress and an amazing friend with whom there was not a single moment of boredom.
"We were waiting for her to pay us a visit since she was in the US with her son but instead, she bid farewell and left us all."
Playwright Haseena Moin remembers her as an irreplaceable asset who always delivered the very best when it came to acting.
On the set, she was Azra apa but when the camera rolled, she became the character she was playing and no one could say that she was the same person.
All her characters in my plays had shades of positive and negative characteristics and handling them was her forte.
She was one of those people who acted for their love of acting and not because of money, which is quite opposite to the acting scenario right now.
Getting an actress of her calibre is not only difficult but also impossible.
The best thing about her was that she had no issues about her educated background as she easily donned the character of an aaya (Fazeelat) in Dhoop Kinaray while was also the rich begum sahiba (Apa Begum) in Tanhaiyaan."
Badar Khalil was all praise and said she knew Azra Sherwani even before her marriage to Shahzad Khalil.
“To me, she was a great human being and I can’t forget the way she loved me and my husband.
She was very upset when my husband passed away since she regarded him as her son and also since he was the one who introduced her on television.
After his death, she refused to work for TV for sometime since she felt that she couldn’t go near the TV station without Shahzad there.
Behroze Sabzwari became quite emotional when asked about her and said she was a great lady and learned people like her should grace acting since the art needs them.
"I knew her for more than 30 years and I can't forget the love she gave to me.
She was jolly on the set, while brave and loving in real life.
She treated me more like a son than a colleague as I was very young when I started acting.
All those who worked with her miss her but to me, she will always remain special."
Azra Sherwani was also associated with advertising and was part of renowned advertising agencies, churning out memorable commercials on TV and the print media as a member of the creative and client management departments.
Her viewers remember the pan-chewing, sari-clad and dominating Apa Begum who showed her anger by repeatedly saying: "Warna mujh se bura koi nahin hoga."
There was no one better than her when it came to character acting as she always portrayed her characters to perfection, making them memorable and lively.
Sherwani was born in Meerut, India, according to family sources.
She married Nafees Sherwani, Air Commodore in the Pakistan Air Force.
She died on December 19, 2005, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States.

Loretta Jones is a fictional character from the British Channel 4 soap opera, "Hollyoaks", and its spin-off series, "Hollyoaks Later".
The character is played by Melissa Walton and first appeared on-screen on 26 November 2008 during the first series of the "Hollyoaks" spin-off "Hollyoaks Later" as a new love interest for the character Dominic Reilly (John Pickard).
She made her first appearance in the "Hollyoaks" series in February 2009 and was the first character to be introduced to the series by producer Lucy Allan.
In 2010 Loretta was axed from the series, along with 15 other characters, during a cast cull by executive producer Paul Marquess.
The character development has Loretta having worked as a pole dancer and Walton put extensive research into the role, including visiting strip clubs.
Despite this occupation Loretta has been portrayed out of conjunction with the blonde stereotype.
She has been involved in storylines which include facing prejudice, body scarring issues and stalking fellow characters.
The character is most noted for the series intending to portray her as a child murderer trying to piece her life back together.
The plot was subsequently axed having caused a great amount of controversy among the British public after newspapers alleged that the storyline was copying a real-life case.
Loretta has been positively received by the media for her appearance and has been dubbed a "blond bombshell".
Before Loretta's departure from the series Marquess made changes to the characters persona: portraying her as a stalker being obsessive, calculating and pretending to have leukaemia.
In her final storyline it was revealed that she had been sexually abused as a child and admitted herself to a psychiatric hospital.
The character of Loretta was created as a temporary love interest for Dominic Reilly (John Pickard) and was intended to feature only in "Hollyoaks Later", the spin-off from the "Hollyoaks" series.
In 2009 it was announced that the "Hollyoaks"<nowiki>'</nowiki> producer Lucy Allan had decided to introduce both Loretta and Cheryl Brady (Bronagh Waugh) into the main show.
Allan said, "Cheryl and Loretta will bring an energy and a sense of fun to the show.
Both Melissa and Bronagh impressed me with their performances in "Hollyoaks Later" and I'm sure viewers will warm to them quickly."
Loretta was initially paired with Dom and, after ending their relationship, was given links to other characters in the series.
To prepare for the role Walton took pole-dancing classes and visited a lap dancing club.
After watching girls perform at the club she carried out routines in her underwear.
She also had a pole set up in her living room to carry on practicing.
Speaking of her research Walton stated: "I loved it.
They didn't ask me to, but I did... I went and I had pole dancing classes.
Though Walton had initially signed on for a three-month stint Allan decided to renew her contract in 2009 and keep Loretta in the series until 2010.
In early 2010 it was announced that Allan had stepped down from the position of executive producer and that Paul Marquess had taken over the role.
It was soon revealed that Marquess planned to give Hollyoaks a "shake up", changing the productions team and beginning a cast cull by axing three established characters.
Stephanie Waring (who plays Cindy Hutchinson) then revealed that all remaining cast members feared their own character would be axed.
One month later Marquess announced his plans to axe a further 11 characters, including Loretta at the end of Walton's contract.
It was also revealed that Loretta would depart at the same time as her current love interest Jake Dean (Kevin Sacre).
On 8 June 2010 Walton filmed her final scenes for the series, along with two fellow cast members Scare and Gerard McCarthy (who plays Kris Fisher).
She spoke of her upset over leaving her fellow cast members, but later said she was looking forward to pursuing other projects.
Walton also confirmed that she was happy the door was left open for a potential return, stating that she would consider reprising her role as Loretta in the future.
Walton also said she understood why Marquess axed her character, he did not feel Loretta had anywhere left to go after the cancellation of her main storyline.
However, she also felt like she deserved another chance to prove herself.
Loretta has stated on-screen that she does not want to conform with the stereotype of a blond pole dancer, and makes it clear that she is a keen bird watcher and enjoys documentaries.
Speaking of the character Walton stated, "I love that Loretta's not a stereotypical stripper sort of girl—there’s a lot more depth to her.
She’s got lots of interesting little hobbies, like bird-watching and Roman history!
Then at night she skips off and turns into a stripper.
It’s like two different lives, and I think many real-life pole-dancers are like that.
They’re really nice, normal girls by day, and by night they turn into these temptresses."
Walton also praised the soap's realistic portrayal of the occupation, saying that many pole dancers attend university or have good professions but rely on stripping for extra money, and that she has met people like her character in the strip club where "Hollyoaks" films scenes.
Walton hopes viewers will find Loretta's alter ego as a stripper tasteful commenting, "As tasteful as you can be in a pink frilly bra and knicker set, with a little skirt that’s more like a belt, and back-combed hair and fake eyelashes!"
Loretta's relationships helped develop the character.
Her first relationship is with Dom Reilly who shares her interests in bird watching, documentaries on ancient Rome and literature.
The relationship immediately gave viewers an insight into the character.
However, as their relationship progressed, it became apparent that Dom could not handle Loretta's profession as he feared for her safety, which ultimately lead to their break up.
Loretta's second relationship is a short-lived fling with Ravi Roy (Stephen Uppal) where she is determined to see the good in him, and help him while he suffers from a brain aneurysm, but ends the relationship when he attempts to assault her.
Loretta then begins a secret romance with Jake, who had tried to murder his child and rape his wife.
Loretta believes he had been misled and is still a good person, demonstrating Loretta's willingness to give people second chances.
Walton comments, "[Loretta] is just lovely – she sees the good in everyone."
When television listings magazine "What's on TV" challenged Walton to explain why Loretta would be interested in Jake after his crimes Walton said, "Loretta's big on forgiveness.
She believes Jake’s changed, that he's learnt from his time inside and he's paid his debt to society."
After Marquess decided to axe Loretta he changed the character's direction and her persona.
She became obsessive over men, controlling towards Jake, manipulative and began lying to get what she wanted.
Jake later decides he does not want her, of this Walton states that: "She's not going anywhere.
She also is shown have "bunny boiler" tendencies, with Walton agreeing to the label.
Walton later revealed that Loretta began pole dancing to have power over men because of the abuse she suffered as a child although, as Loretta's exit approached, she was now a dangerous and deluded woman.
In November 2009 Loretta became the centre of media controversy when various media outlets announced that Loretta would be part of a storyline which revealed that she had murdered a child in her past.
The controversy began when tabloid newspaper "The Sun" compared the storyline to the real life murder of James Bulger.
Bulger had been murdered when he was two years old by two young children.
Being just 10 years of age they were handed small sentences to serve and were later released with new identities.
Soon afterwards various other news sources and lifestyle magazines picked up the story and mimicked "The Sun" and its claims.
Bulger's mother, Denise Fergus, condemned the storyline.
While speaking to the news website Click Liverpool she criticised the decision to air a plot that allegedly mirrored her son's death, stating they should have consulted her first.
She said, "I'm shocked and disgusted at what "Hollyoaks" is doing.
They have clearly based this story on what happened to James and it's outrageous that they should do this without consulting with me in any way."
She threatened to encourage a boycott of the show.
Channel 4 released a statement defending the plot, explaining it had nothing to do with any real life case: "The forthcoming storyline is not based on any real-life case and it will in no way seek to recreate real events.
The storyline focuses on the psychological repercussions for two characters in the show who were responsible for the death of a 12-year-old girl in the past."
The storyline would answer questions for viewers who had been speculating on Loretta's secret past.
It would reveal that Loretta had spent time in prison for her crime, was born with the name Joanna Norman, and is living under a false identity.
Speaking about delving into her character's history Walton commented to entertainment website Digital Spy, "It took a little while and until now, we've known little about her.
Nobody in the village knows who she is or where she's come from.
She's just planted herself in the village knowing hardly anybody.
I'm absolutely loving the opportunity to explore her backstory."
Speaking about her reaction to the plot she continued, "I was like, 'Oh my gosh!'
I was so shocked but absolutely chuffed to bits because this is what all actors want – something massive like this to sink my teeth into.
I feel so privileged that they've trusted me with this story.
I know they've wanted to do it for a while and they've finally chosen me!"
In the same interview Walton described the storyline, "Loretta and Chrissy were best, best friends through childhood.
She somehow tracks Loretta down and turns up out of the blue after Loretta's finished a dance class.
What we learn is that when they were 12, they bullied a young girl and didn't stop until they killed her.
Since then, Loretta and Chrissy have been completely separated from each other, their families and friends.
They've spent years in institutions having psychiatric and behavioural treatment."
Kevin Sacre, whose character was directly involved in the storyline, voiced his support for the plot stating: "I think the fact that it's the sort of thing that happens in real life means it's something that should be addressed.
Anyone who buries their head in the sand is a bit naïve.
And I think soap is a medium where you can explore issues of real life."
Just days before the episodes were set to transmit Channel 4 announced that it was axing the storyline, due in part to Fergus's reaction to the storyline.
Whilst Walton had previously claimed the storyline was about three twelve-year-old girls, Channel 4 admitted the similarities between the story and the Bulger case.
"This particular storyline was not based on any real life case and was not intended to recreate actual events.
However, after conversations with Denise Fergus we have agreed to amend certain aspects of the storyline."
Amber Hodgkiss, who was cast to play Chrissy, expressed her disappointment over the decision to axe the plot all together saying, "The storyline has been completely cut.
I would like it to go ahead, but I don't have that decision.
It wasn't based on Jamie Bulger, but people portrayed it that way.
It was quite a big storyline that could affect people, but it happens."
Fergus said she was grateful that the plot was axed saying, "I'm grateful that they are respecting my wishes.
I made it clear that I did not want those scenes broadcast and I'm pleased to say they clearly understood my feelings."
When episodes that were intended to feature the storyline transmitted, they instead featured a selection of then "last minute" scenes.
In these scenes Hodgkiss portrays a new character, Caroline, who holds Loretta and Jake hostage.
Marquess began writing scripts to facilitate Loretta's departure as Walton's filming was to finish in June 2010, with a departure date of August that same year.
Her exit from the series was described as dramatic, with Walton commenting on this during an interview with magazine programme "Live from Studio Five" stating, "I'm very pleased with my exit, you know.
I've probably enjoyed the last few months of filming more than I've enjoyed anything else that I've done, to be honest."
Loretta's backstory gradually began to unfold on-screen.
Loretta decided she needed to win Jake back.
Her ex-boyfriend Adam (Vlach Ashton) warned Jake that Loretta had previously stalked him.
This starts to damage their relationship and during an interview with "What's on TV" Walton commented on it saying that Jake was suspicious of Loretta's motives.
Loretta love for Jake turned into an obsession with Walton saying, "She's definitely not giving up on him.
What he thought was love is already actually an obsession.
The story line reveals her past of obsessions with men and Walton stated, "You sense Adam wasn't the only ex-partner she stalked.
Walton explains the cause of her behaviour, "You find out much later on that it's because of something that happened in her past.
Her obsession really is getting full-on [...] She's jealous of anybody who gets Jake's attention."
After Jake's sister Steph Cunningham (Carley Stenson) is diagnosed with cervical cancer Loretta pretends she once had leukaemia in order to trap Jake.
He throws her out though because his son had previously suffered from the illness.
Loretta refuses to give up and her behaviour becomes more erratic.
In the final episodes of her departure Loretta manages to convince everyone that Jake was mentally ill once more.
She takes Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox) hostage for snooping into her life with Adam and Walton states, "Loretta is dangerous and deluded, Nancy's terrified of her – she tries to escape but Loretta won't let her She accidentally pushes Nancy, who crashes into a table and bangs her head badly".
Walton also revealed more of Loretta's past saying, "Adam confesses that Loretta was violent towards him, basically she did some awful things to him that she's doing to Jake now."
The storyline sought to explain all the unanswered questions left in her backstory with Walton saying, "He [Jake] tries to talk her round, and at that point she reveals she was sexually abused when she was very young.
It's supposedly the reason she went into stripping to have power over men."
Walton also defended Loretta's final actions, saying the character was confused and did not mean to hurt anyone.
In Loretta's final scene she voluntarily admits herself into a psychiatric hospital after being convinced to by Jake.
Loretta first appears as a stripper who works in a lap-dancing club.
During her job Loretta meets Dom.
The pair like each other but she decides not to go out with him, she feels he is not yet over the death of his wife Tina (Leah Hackett).
Loretta is not seen again until February 2009, when she and Dom begin a relationship.
Loretta clashes with Mercedes Fisher (Jennifer Metcalfe) who is not happy to find out that Dom has moved on from Tina.
Loretta moves in with Cindy Cunningham (Stephanie Waring) and Darren Osborne (Ashley Taylor Dawson).
Loretta lies to Dom saying she has quit her job and does not tell him the truth until Darren finds out and begins to blackmail her.
Loretta then quits her job for Dom, but later finds a new job as a stripper at a different club.
Dom worries about Loretta's safety at her job and gives her a rape alarm, much to her amusement.
Loretta reassures him, but realises how serious it is for him when he reveals that Tina's abduction and death has left him uptight about safety.
They then end their relationship.
Loretta drunkenly teaches Nancy Hayton, Zoe Carpenter (Zoë Lister), Hannah Ashworth (Emma Rigby) and Sarah Barnes (Loui Batley) how to dance in the Student Union bar.
She slips and falls onto some glass bottles which break and cut her stomach.
Loretta is horrified when she is left scarred by the glass.
Her boss sacks her, because her scars have rendered her unattractive, and Loretta is given a job in Tan & Tumble by Ash Roy (Junade Khan).
Loretta develops a crush on Ravi Roy which makes his brother Ash jealous.
After Loretta catches Ravi being violent towards his sister Leila (Lena Kaur) she distances herself from him and Ash starts flirting with her.
Ash kisses Loretta and Ravi sees it and lashes out at.
This leads an angry Ravi to fight in an illegal boxing match.
After Ravi taunts Ash he punches Ravi, who was diagnosed with an aneurysm, and Ravi falls into a coma.
Loretta explains to Kris Fisher (Gerard McCarthy) and Anita Roy (Saira Choudhry) that Ash tried to kiss her, which Kris believes and Ash tries to deny.
When Nancy's abusive ex-husband Jake Dean, who tried to rape her and kill his and his ex-wife Becca's son Charlie (Joshua McConville), returns to the village Loretta consoles Nancy and moves in with her.
Loretta grows close to Jake and, although initially hesitant, forms a relationship with him.
After Jake and Loretta go public, Loretta is kicked out by Nancy and moves in with Jake.
When Jake's sister Steph Cunningham (Carley Stenson) suggests the pair are moving too quickly Loretta agrees, she talks to Jake who gets angry showing his temper to Loretta for the first time.
Loretta strikes up a friendship with Holly Hutchinson (Lydia Waters) who aspires to be a dancer like Loretta after feeling unnoticed by her mother Cindy.
As they bond Loretta gives Holly advice on dancing.
Loretta faces prejudice when she starts applying for new jobs, as no one will employ her due to her previous jobs as a stripper.
She later lies during an interview, her interviewers discover her previous employment and make derogatory remarks to her.
Holly runs away from home and a large-scale police investigation is put in place to find her.
Many other residents in the village suspect Loretta's boyfriend Jake of being her kidnapper, unaware that she is safe and hiding in Darren's flat.
Loretta leaves Jake after she begins to doubt his innocence but later reconciles with him.
After Jake finds Holly he chases her, she falls over and takes a blow to the head and falls into a coma.
Initially the police suspect that Jake was behind this but later release him.
Loretta once more begins to doubt him.
Upset, Jake goes to stay with his old friend Caroline (Amber Hodgkiss).
After sleeping with him Caroline drugs him, ties him up, tries to kill him, and holds him hostage for a few days.
She is angered to learn he is going out with Loretta and sets out to try to kill Holly but Loretta is there by Holly's bedside.
Caroline tries to attack Loretta with a syringe needle but Jake saves Loretta and, in the process, Caroline is stabbed with the needle.
After the ordeal Loretta disappears, having to accept the fact that Jake had cheated on her much to his dismay.
She returns but while she was away Loretta had become involved with a realtor called Adam.
At first Jake thought she was looking for a home.
However, when he saw them both arguing, Jake realises something was not as it seemed.
When Jake confronts Loretta she tells him that Adam was harassing her.
This leads to Jake confronting Adam and warning him to stay away from Loretta.
However Adam tells him that Loretta had been controlling his life and that she wants to be with him.
Adam explains that Loretta had told him about Jake and that he was the biggest mistake of her life in the hope that Adam would take her back.
Later she goes on a night out to The Loft nightclub and threatens Charlotte Lau (Amy Yamazaki).

Loretta has been noted in the media because of her "sexy blonde" image.
When she was axed from the series a magazine dedicated to "sexually attractive females" titled "Babemag" commented that the series would not be the same without her and praised Walton's portrayal, stating, "Sundays may never be quite the same as news filters through that Hollyoaks star, Melissa Walton, is to get the chop from the teen soap.
Horny Hollyoaks hangover TV might not be the same for us without the charms of Melissa Walton who plays Loretta Jones in the series."
She has also been dubbed a "blonde bombshell" by media sources such as "Digital Spy" and the "South Wales Evening Post".
Five's soap opera reporting website "Holy Soap" describe Loretta's finest moment as her food fight with Mercedes when they clashed over Dom.

The Canada–Panama Free Trade Agreement is a free trade agreement between Canada and Panama that went into effect April 1, 2013.
The agreement was concluded on August 11, 2009 by Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli and signed by the two countries' trade ministers on May 14, 2010.
The agreement was approved by both countries' parliaments by December 2012, allowing the agreement to come into effect.
The agreement eliminates Panamanian tariffs on 90% of goods from Canada.
The remaining 10% will be phased out within the next 10 years.
Canada will remove 99% of its tariffs on goods from Panama.
Panama will end its ban on beef from Canada which was initiated after cases of mad cow disease were found in Canada in 2003.
In 2008, bilateral merchandise trade between Canada and Panama totaled $149.1 million.
Trade has increased by 48 percent from 2007.
Canada made up $127.9 million of total trade between the two countries, while Panama made up the remaining $21.2 million.
Both countries parliament needed to approve the agreement before it could come into force.
The Canadian opposition parties had considered stalling the agreement over the issue of Panama being considered a tax haven.
The agreement was negotiated over four meetings.
The first negotiation started in October 2008.
The negotiations followed two exploratory meeting over a possible agreement.
In 1998, Panama and Canada signed the Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement (FIPA).
This agreement placed rights and obligations on foreign direct investments between the two countries.

The organisation was founded in 1874 as the Democratic and Trades Alliance Association.
Most of its initial members were tailors or shoemakers based in Soho, many had been active Chartists and, later, supporters of James Bronterre O'Brien, and almost all were active in the First International.
They included Maltman Barry, Johann Eccarius, Robert Gammage, John Bedford Leno, Charles Murray, James Murray, John Rogers, William Townshend and Henry Travis.
In 1875, the club renamed itself as the "Manhood Suffrage League", taking its name from the northern section of the Reform League.
Around this time, Frank Kitz came into contact with the group.
In 1877, Maltman Barry, by then the club's secretary, became an outspoken supporter of the Tory campaign to intervene in the Russo-Turkish War.
Much of the group objected to this, and the organisation ceased to function by the end of the year.
However, it subsequently revived, and by the early 1880s, it had become more interested in socialism.
It is administratively part of the city of Vladivostok in Primorsky Krai, Russia, and is located south of the city center.
Reyneke Island has an area of approximately and a population of 23 (2005), making it the smallest of four inhabited islands of Primorsky Krai both by area and population.
Most residents live in the island's single settlement of the same named located on the northern coast.
Pinales of the Korean pine variety are found on the island.
The islet of Vykent Island and many kekurs are found around the coast.
Reyneke Island is connected to mainland Vladivostok by a ferry, operating three times a week in the warm seasons.
Reyneke Island was named after Mikhail Reyneke, Vice Admiral of the Imperial Russian Navy and an early hydrographer of the Russian Hydrographic Service in the region.
INSAT-1B was an Indian communications satellite which formed part of the Indian National Satellite System.
Launched in 1983, it was operated in geostationary orbit at a longitude of 74 degrees east.
At the end of its seven-year design life it was replaced by the newly launched INSAT-1D, dropping to backup status.
In 1992, it was relocated to 93° east, before being decommissioned in August 1993.
Built by Ford Aerospace and operated by the Indian National Satellite System, INSAT-1B was based upon a custom satellite bus developed for the INSAT-1 series of satellites.
It had a mass at launch of , and was expected to operate for seven years.
The spacecraft carried twelve C and three S band transponders, powered by a single solar array.
A stabilisation boom was used to counterbalance radiation torques from the satellite's asymmetrical design.
The spacecraft was propelled by an R-4D-11 apogee motor.
INSAT-1B was deployed by during the STS-8 mission.
"Challenger" lifted off from Launch Complex 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at 06:32:00 UTC on 30 August 1983.
INSAT-1B was deployed from the orbiter's payload bay at 07:48 UTC on 31 August, with a PAM-D upper stage firing shortly afterwards to place it into geosynchronous transfer orbit.
The spacecraft used its own propulsion system to raise itself into geostationary orbit.
It received the International Designator 1983-089B and Satellite Catalog Number 14318.
After some initial problems deploying its solar array, INSAT-1B became operational in October 1983.
It was located at 74° east for most of its operational life, before being moved to 93° east in 1992.
In August 1993 it was decommissioned and raised to a graveyard orbit slightly above geosynchronous altitude.

Mercer Ice Stream , formerly Ice Stream A, flows west to Gould Coast to the south of Whillans Ice Stream, Antarctica.
It is the southernmost of several major ice streams draining from Marie Byrd Land into the Ross Ice Shelf.
The ice streams were investigated and mapped by U.S. Antarctic Research Program personnel in a number of field seasons from 1983–84 and named Ice Stream A, B, C, etc., according to their position from south to north.
The name was changed by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names in 2002 to honor Quaternary geologist John H. Mercer (1922–87) of the Institute of Polar Studies (now the Byrd Polar Research Center), Ohio State University, who mapped the moraines above Reedy Glacier and in the Ohio Range at the head of Horlick Ice Stream, the major tributaries to Mercer Ice Stream.

The Battle of Preston (17–19 August 1648), fought largely at Walton-le-Dale near Preston in Lancashire, resulted in a victory for the New Model Army under the command of Oliver Cromwell over the Royalists and Scots commanded by the Duke of Hamilton.
The Parliamentarian victory presaged the end of the Second English Civil War.
On 8 July 1648, when the Scottish Engager army crossed the Border in support of the English Royalist, the military situation was well defined.
For the Parliamentarians, Cromwell besieged Pembroke in South Wales, Fairfax besieged Colchester in Essex, and Colonel Edward Rossiter besieged Pontefract and Scarborough in the north.
On 11 July, Pembroke fell and Colchester followed on 28 August.
Elsewhere, however, the rebellion, which had been put down by rapidity of action rather than sheer weight of numbers, still smouldered.
Charles, the Prince of Wales, with the fleet cruised along the Essex coast.
Cromwell and John Lambert, however, understood each other perfectly, while the Scottish commanders quarrelled with each other and with Sir Marmaduke Langdale (the English Royalist commander in the north west).
As the English Royalist uprisings were close to collapse, it was on the adventures of the Engager Scottish army that the interest of the war centred.
It was by no means the veteran army of the Earl of Leven, which had long been disbanded.
For the most part it consisted of raw levies and, as the Kirk party had refused to sanction The Engagement (an agreement between Charles I and the Scots Parliament for the Scots to intervene in England on behalf of Charles), David Leslie and thousands of experienced officers and men declined to serve.
The leadership of the Duke of Hamilton proved to be a poor substitute for that of Leslie.
Hamilton's army, too, was so ill provided that as soon as England was invaded it began to plunder the countryside for the bare means of sustenance.
On 8 July the Scots, with Langdale as advanced guard, were about Carlisle, and reinforcements from Ulster were expected daily.
Lambert's horse were at Penrith, Hexham and Newcastle, too weak to fight and having only skilful leading and rapidity of movement to enable them to gain time.
Appleby Castle surrendered to the Scots on 31 July, whereat Lambert, who was still hanging on to the flank of the Scottish advance, fell back from Barnard Castle to Richmond so as to close Wensleydale against any attempt of the invaders to march on Pontefract.
All the restless energy of Langdale's horse was unable to dislodge Lambert from the passes or to find out what was behind that impenetrable cavalry screen.
Cromwell had received the surrender of Pembroke Castle on 11 July, and had marched off, with his men unpaid, ragged and shoeless, at full speed through the Midlands.
Rains and storms delayed his march, but he knew that Hamilton in the broken ground of Westmorland was still worse off.
Shoes from Northampton and stockings from Coventry met him, at Nottingham, and, gathering up the local levies as he went, he made for Doncaster, where he arrived on 8 August, having gained six days in advance of the time he had allowed himself for the march.
He then called up artillery from Hull, exchanged his local levies for the regulars who were besieging Pontefract, and set off to meet Lambert.
Hamilton was at Lancaster, and Sir George Monro with the Scots from Ulster and the Carlisle Royalists (organized as a separate command owing to friction between Monro and the generals of the main army) at Hornby.
On 13 August, while Cromwell was marching to join Lambert at Otley, the Scottish leaders were still disputing whether they should make for Pontefract or continue through Lancashire so as to join Lord Byron and the Cheshire Royalists.
On 14 August 1648 Cromwell and Lambert were at Skipton, on 15 August at Gisburn and on 16 August they marched down the valley of the Ribble towards Preston with full knowledge of the enemy's dispositions and full determination to attack him.
They had with them horse and foot not only of the Army, but also of the militia of Yorkshire, Durham, Northumberland and Lancashire, and withal were slightly outnumbered, having only 8,600 men against perhaps 9,000 of Hamilton's command.
But the latter were scattered for convenience of supply along the road from Lancaster, through Preston, towards Wigan, Langdale's corps having thus become the left flank guard instead of the advanced guard.
Langdale called in his advanced parties, perhaps with a view to resuming the duties of advanced guard, on the night of 13 August, and collected them near Longridge.
It is not clear whether he reported Cromwell's advance, but, if he did, Hamilton ignored the report, for on 17 August Monro was half a day's march to the north, Langdale east of Preston, and the main army strung out on the road to Wigan, Major-General William Baillie with a body of foot, the rear of the column, being still in Preston.
Hamilton, yielding to the importunity of his lieutenant-general, James Livingston, 1st Earl of Callendar, sent Baillie across the Ribble to follow the main body just as Langdale, with 3,000 foot and 500 horse only, met the first shock of Cromwell's attack on Preston Moor.
Hamilton, like Charles at Edgehill, passively shared in, without directing, the Battle of Preston, and, though Langdale's men fought magnificently, they were after four hours' struggle driven to the Ribble.
Baillie attempted to cover the Ribble and Darwen bridges on the Wigan road, but Cromwell had forced his way across both before nightfall.
Pursuit was at once undertaken, and not relaxed until Hamilton had been driven through Wigan and Winwick to Uttoxeter and Ashbourne.
There, pressed furiously in rear by Cromwell's horse and held up in front by the militia of the midlands, the remnant of the Scottish army laid down its arms on 25 August.
Various attempts were made to raise the Royalist standard in Wales and elsewhere, but Preston was the death-blow to the Royalist hopes in the Second Civil War.
Cromwell estimated the Royalist losses at 2,000 killed and 9,000 captured.
Those among the prisoners who had served voluntarily were bound for servile labour in the New World, and when there was no more demand there, for service in the Republic of Venice When the English Parliament decreed a day of thanksgiving for the victory, it was announced that Cromwell's army had "one hundred at the most" killed.
The Battle of Preston is depicted in Robert Neil's historical novel "Witch Bane".
As noted by Neil in his historical note, it is difficult to reconstruct with certainty precisely where in Preston the battle took place.
Both accounts are weak on topography, since neither of the military commanders knew the ground.
Neil's protagonists are two women, caught up in the fighting, desperately trying to survive while also deeply worried about their respective lovers who are fighting on opposing sides.
The topography is crucial to the plot's depiction of the women trying to escape the fighting.
Before writing, Neil studied extensively the existing sources and walked repeatedly around the battleground.
What Cromwell described as "A lane, very deep and ill, up to the Enemy's army and leading to the Town" is also mentioned by Sir Marmaduke, who blames his Scottish allies for having failed to secure that lane, whose eventual capture enabled the Parliamentary forces to outflank the Royalists.
Neil's plot and the route taken by his protagonists is based on the assumption that this crucial lane followed more or less the line of the present A59 road through Brockholes to Blackburn.
Neil concedes, however, that other interpretations of the battle's topography are possible.
Blanche Honegger Moyse (September 23, 1909 – February 10, 2011) was a conductor who lived in Brattleboro, Vermont at the time of her death.
She was particularly admired for her devotion to the choral works of Johann Sebastian Bach and her ability to draw deeply moving performances from both amateur and professional musicians.
Soprano Arleen Auger has said of her, "I’ve sung Bach all over the world, often with people who are considered the best, and in my opinion no one is performing Bach any better than Blanche Moyse is doing it in Brattleboro."
She had been pointed out by the writer Benjamin Ivry as perhaps having been "classical music's best kept secret."
Wall Street Journal critic Greg Sandow said of her performance of Bach's St. John Passion at the age of 89: "Sometimes you hear a concert that sticks with you.
For months you think about it, keeping it alive in your mind, unable to banish it merely to memory."
Moyse was born in Geneva, Switzerland, where she began the study of violin at the age of eight.
She went on to study with Adolf Busch, and made her debut at the age of 16, when she played the Beethoven violin concerto with l'Orchestre de la Suisse Romande.
She married the pianist and flutist Louis Moyse and, with Moyse's father, flautist Marcel Moyse, formed the award-winning Moyse Trio.
In 1949, the Moyses moved to Marlboro, Vermont at the invitation of Busch and Rudolf Serkin, and helped found the Marlboro Music Festival.
Moyse also chaired the music department at Marlboro College for the next 25 years, and founded the Brattleboro Music Center in 1952.
Her violin career ended in 1966 with an injury to her bow arm, but she went on to become a much admired conductor of the choral works of Bach.
She made her Carnegie Hall debut at the age of 78, conducting the Blanche Moyse Chorale and the Orchestra of St. Luke's in a production of Bach's Christmas Oratorio, and she continued to conduct Bach's major choral works—the "Mass in B Minor", the "St Matthew Passion" and the "St John Passion"—at annual concerts of the New England Bach Festival well into her 90's.
In 2000 Blanche Moyse was awarded the Alfred Nash Patterson Lifetime Achievement Award by Choral Arts New England in recognition of her exceptional contributions to choruses and the appreciation of choral music in New England.
Moyse died at her home in Brattleboro, Vermont, on February 10, 2011 at the age of 101.
Gudachari 116 is a 1966 Telugu spy film written by Aarudhra, and directed by M. Mallikharjuna Rao.
The film stars Krishna, Jayalalitha, Rajanala and Mukkamala in pivotal roles.
"Gudachari 116", the first spy film in Telugu and India, starring Superstar Krishna and Jayalalithaa, became such a smash hit that many sequels to the film were made in later years.
In this James Bond style film, Jayalalithaa played a vamp-like character.
She was still at the beginning of her career, and this film brought out her talent and brought her recognition.
Secret Agent 116 named Gopi has been assigned the case of the homicide of a fellow secret agent (303) by the head of CID.
303 had found evidence that can help identify the perpetrators.
During this investigation, Gopi meets lovely Radha in a flight journey, and both end up falling in love with each other.
The traitor responsible for the killing of agent 303 has gone to meet 303's sister Kamla and tells her that he is a CID inspector and investigating his brother's case, warning that her brother's killer may make an attempt on her pretending as his colleague and friend.
He elsewhere unsuccessfully continued on the life of agent 116.
116 goes to meet Kamla and sees 303's portrait and notes down the studio photographer's name, but Kamla is convinced that 116 is the killer of her brother.
Kamla is approached by another mafia don, Damodar, for her help in eliminating 116, to which she agrees.
Damodar turns out to be Radha's father, when Radha introduces him, Gopi gets suspicious about him and commences a background check, which reveals that her father is a gangster.
As he sets out his case against Damodar, he continues his romance with Radha.
During Radha's birthday party, Damodar directs his henchman to kill 116, who escapes after some car chase.
116 hesitantly reveals to Radha that her father is a gangster.
Heartbroken, Radha confronts her father, who tells her that he was forced into his life of crime and terrorism, and some other person controls them all, which was overheard by 116 and his assistant, who are hiding outside.
116 goes out for his search for the real culprit to a skyscraper apartment where Kamla was plotted.
Kamla seductively dances and mixes some intoxicant pill in his drink, which overlooked by 116, eventually made him senseless.
Goons take him to their secret den in the city outskirts, along with Radha, who mistakes them as Hospital Ward boys.
In the den, 116 captures one of the goon leaders and forces him to reveal some information.
116 fights his way with Radha and escapes in a vehicle.
In the meantime, CID agents trace a letter leading to clues regarding the Chinese conspiracy to destabilize the nation and accommodated by traitors inside, led by a person wearing a Mao uniform named Supremo, who only speaks a few broken English sentences.
The rest of the movie follows 116's efforts to thwart a foreign conspiracy against India.
Louis the Stammerer was physically weak and outlived his father by only two years.
He succeeded his younger brother Charles the Child as the ruler of Aquitaine in 866 and his father in West Francia in 877, but he was never crowned Emperor.
In the French monarchial system, he is considered Louis II.
Louis was crowned king on 8 October 877 by Hincmar, archbishop of Reims, at Compiegne and was crowned a second time in August 878 by Pope John VIII at Troyes while the pope was attending a council there.
The pope may have even offered him the imperial crown, but it was declined.
He was described "a simple and sweet man, a lover of peace, justice, and religion".
In 878, he gave the counties of Barcelona, Girona, and Besalú to Wilfred the Hairy.
His final act was to march against the invading Vikings, but he fell ill and died on 9 April or 10 April 879, not long after beginning this final campaign.
On his death, his realms were divided between his two sons, Carloman II and Louis III of France.
During the peace negotiations between his father and Erispoe, duke of Brittany, Louis was betrothed to an unnamed daughter of Erispoe in 856.
It is not known if this was the same daughter who later married Gurivant.
The contract was broken in 857 after Erispoe's murder.
Louis was married twice.
His first wife Ansgarde of Burgundy had two sons: Louis (born in 863) and Carloman (born in 866), both of whom became kings of West Francia, and two daughters: Hildegarde (born in 864) and Gisela (865–884).
The Apusomonadida are an taxonomic group of protozan zooflagellates, that appear to be the sister group to the Opisthokonts.
Together with the Breviatea, these form the Obazoa clade.

There is an effort to clarify the relationships between these genera.
The U.S. China Policy Foundation (USCPF) is an American non-governmental organization that works to improve United States-China relations.
The group believes that specific misunderstandings and mis-perceptions within both countries inhibit co-operation, and it seeks to discuss those.
The group states that it does not advocate foreign policy decisions and does not try to influence government decisions.
The late American ambassadors John H. Holdridge and Arthur Hummel, Jr. founded the group with Chi Wang in 1995.
Throughout the 1990s and onwards, it assisted American businesses trying to work with the Chinese.
is an advertising slogan coined for Pepsi at JWT by Anuja Chauhan in 1998.
It combines Hindustani and English, and literally meaning "This Heart Desires More", which later became a popular slogan.
The worldwide Pepsi commercial featuring the song, "Ask for More", written by Janet Jackson was released in November 1998, later released a single in January 1999.
The slogan has its origins as a commercial slogan for Pepsi advertisement in 1998, at JWT by Anuja Chauhan who eventually became Vice President and Executive Creative Director at JWT, Delhi, and author of books like, "The Zoya Factor" (2008).
Thereafter it soon gained mass popularity, and became a battle slogan and rallying cry, first used by Capt. Vikram Batra, an officer of the Indian Army, during the 1999 Kargil War and widely reported in the media.
Captain Batra was martyred during the war in July 1999 was posthumously awarded the Param Vir Chakra, India's highest military honour.
The slogan continues to be a part of the Indian popular culture.
In 2004, it was used as a title for a Bollywood movie, "Dil Maange More" starring Shahid Kapoor.
The slogan was coined as a tagline for a Pepsi television advertisement series that first ran in December 1998 and sought to establish Pepsi as a strong brand with Indian youth.
It was a continuation of Pepsi's advertising campaign in the mid-to-late nineties, which it had initially launched as an ambush marketing effort against Coca-Cola during the 1996 Cricket World Cup.
The ads featured prominent sports personalities and film stars, such as Sachin Tendulkar, Shahrukh Khan, Amitabh Bachchan, and Pawan Kalyan and were directed by Prahlad Kakkar, a veteran ad film director.
The catchphrase became a runaway success and other business entities sought to appropriate it in their messaging.
Pepsi litigated actively to assert an exclusive right to use the slogan.

The TUC was a founding member of the Jamaica Confederation of Trade Unions.
The Trade Union Congress came into existence as a result of shifts in politics in Jamaica in the 1940s and early 1950s.
In 1943 differences between the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union (BITU) and People's National Party (PNP) led to the formation of the "Trade Union Council" which grouped 16 small unions together in alignment to the PNP, in contrast to BITU which was responsible for the foundation of the Jamaica Labour Party in that year.
In 1946 the TUC was reorganised as the "Trade Union Congress" and in 1948 14 of the member unions were merged into a single union under the same name, with two unions remaining separate but affiliated.
Rapid learning (or Rapid eLearning Development) has traditionally referred to a methodology to build e-learning courses rapidly.
Typically the author will create slides in PowerPoint, record narration on top of the slides, and then use software to add tests, or even collaboration activities between the slides.
The whole package is then sent, most often as an Adobe Flash file, to a learning management system or website.
E-learning has grown rapidly since the 1990s but developers and organizations were confronted by the complexity of authoring processes.
The difficulty and expense of building online courses from scratch led to the idea of recycling existing resources like Powerpoint presentations, and transforming them into e-learning courses.
A traditional e-learning development project can take several months.
In contrast the aim of rapid e-learning is to build and roll out content modules within weeks.
For example, while one hour of standard e-learning can take 73 to 220 hours to develop, a PowerPoint to e-learning conversion can be estimated to take an average of 33 hours to develop.
In this usage, it refers not to how rapidly a module can be created by an e-learning developer, but how rapidly it can be viewed by a learner.
Most of them are authoring tools that include rapid learning as a feature.
Some of these tools treat each slide as a learning object and allow to add tests and online activities between the slides.
Some of these software are online services, the others are desktop applications to install on your computer.
A trend of the market is also to combine rapid learning (conversion of PowerPoint presentations) with screencast (filming your screen and your mouse movements) so as to provide both a sequence of slides and applications demos.
This combination is particularly powerful when authoring courses on how to use a software.
After 2000, a series of rapid learning tools were proposed on the market and became popular because of their simplicity and the feeling that anyone could build an e-learning course from a simple PowerPoint presentation.
Some experts have highlighted the limits of this method or even insisted on the fact that rapid learning was the consequence of the misapprehension that if a face-to-face course worked well with PowerPoint, it would function equally well online.
This criticism of rapid learning development focuses on the idea that the richness of an interaction with students in the classroom is not encapsulated in a PowerPoint presentation file.
Rapid learning has been criticized for ignoring the axiom that people "learn by doing".
More globally, the critics of rapid learning have followed the same track as the critics on the use of PowerPoint in education.
Many developers and organizations are able for the first time to build their online course without the help of an e-learning team (including instructional designers, art designers and other contributors).
The overall evolution of internet practice and the development of the Web 2.0 collaboration scenarios might lead trainers to other scenarios.
Rapid learning is seen an inheritance of the CD-ROM model and the idea that e-learning consists in an individual self-paced practice.
Students often complain that self-paced individual learning can be unengaging and offers little chances of interaction, correction and success.
This can be overcome through scenarios where the information is presented as rapid learning modules encapsulated in Flash SCORM packages or distributed on Learning Management Systems, and the learning activities developed through other tools, such as blogs, wikis, forums or videoconferences.

Founded in 2003 as a result of Kyle Wiens not finding an Apple iBook G3 repair manual while the founders were attending Cal Poly, the company sells repair parts and publishes free wiki-like online repair guides for consumer electronics and gadgets on its web site.
The company also performs product teardowns of consumer devices.
iFixit has released product teardowns of new mobile and laptop devices, which provides advertising for the company's parts and equipment sales.
These teardowns have been covered by "PC World" (now defunct), the "Mac Observer", "NetworkWorld" and other publications.
Co-founder Kyle Wiens has said he aims to reduce electronic waste by teaching people to repair their own gear, and by offering tools, parts, and a forum to discuss repairs.
In 2011, he traveled through Africa with a documentary team.
iFixit provides a software as a service platform known as Dozuki to allow others to use iFixit's documentation framework to produce their own documentation.
O'Reilly Media's "Make" and "Craft" magazines use Dozuki to feature community guides alongside instructions originally written by the staff for the print magazine.
In September 2015, Apple removed the iFixit app from the App Store in reaction to the company's publication of a teardown of a developer pre-release version of the Apple TV (4th generation) obtained under Apple's Developer Program violating a signed Non-Disclosure Agreement and as such their developer account was suspended.
In response iFixit says it has worked on improving its mobile site for users to access its services through a mobile browser.
On April 3, 2014 iFixit announced a partnership with Fairphone

The incentive payment rate was the percentage needed to bring the national average return to producers (the market price plus the incentive payment) up to the annually set national support price.
Each producer’s direct payment was the payment rate times the market receipts.
Producers with higher market receipts got larger support payments.
This created an incentive to increase output and to improve quality.
The wool and mohair commodity programs ended after the 1995 marketing year as required by P.L. 103-130.
For conservation programs, incentive payments refer to cost-sharing payments that producers may receive to attract participation.
In some programs, the federal portion of these payments can vary; for these programs, the higher share is provided for the more desirable conservation practices that will provide greater benefits.
Brandon Hall is a Greek Revival architecture style house built in 1856 in Washington, Mississippi, United States.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.
Majestic Brandon Hall was formally a large working cotton plantation located on the scenic Natchez Trace.
The land on which Brandon Hall now stands first passed into private ownership as a royal grant from the Spanish King Carlos III in 1788.
In 1809 the property was sold at public auction to William Lock Chew for the sum of $7,000.
Chew constructed the first permanent dwelling consisting of a three-room brick house about twenty by sixty feet, built sometime between 1809 and 1820.
This structure still exists as the "basement" of the present house known as Brandon Hall.
In 1833 Chew sold the property to Nathaniel Hoggatt, a successful planter whose daughter Charlotte inherited the land after his death.
On October 29, 1840, Charlotte Hoggatt married Gerard Brandon III, who was the son of an early Governor of Mississippi and the grandson of a Revolutionary War Hero of the same name.
They lived in this original dwelling until 1853, when they began construction of Brandon Hall which was completed in 1856.
In January 1914, the plantation, house, and land was sold to George Hightower as a result of a default on a promissory note, thus ending an 81-year chain of ownership by the Brandon and Hoggatt families.
These 81 years extended from Mississippi's frontier days during the period of grace and plenty before the Civil War, and through the South's darkest hours after the war.
In 1987 the home was completely renovated and restored, perfectly duplicating the original construction.
In 2009 the owners of the house, Edward L. and James R. Diefenthal of New Orleans, Louisiana, donated the house to the Historic Natchez Foundation.
In December 2009 the home was purchased by Ron and Kathy Garber of Lafayette, Louisiana, who opened it for Bed and Breakfast accommodation.

Lyon Hunter is a fictional character on the popular American daytime soap opera "As the World Turns", portrayed by Evan Alex Cole.
Hunter first arrived in Oakdale after being promoted from the IT Department of Worldwide by Lucinda Walsh to become Emily Stewart's new co-editor at "The Intruder", when the decision was made to move the paper online.
On his first day Hunter did not make a good first impression with Emily when it became apparent that he was quite clumsy and when Emily asked him if Hunter was his first or last name.
He replied that it was his last name, and that his first name was not important, as everyone calls him Hunter.
Later when Emily started to get agitated at Hunter's suggestions for the site, including changing the name of the paper, she decided to head out to Yo's for a drink with Hunter following her.
Once they were there Hunter once again put his foot in it when he commented on Emily's age by saying that people of her “generation” may not understand how the Internet works.
As time went on Hunter once again showed his clumsy side by falling into Emily, with Alison, Casey and Jade looking on thinking that he is her new boy toy.
After Emily left, Alison went to talk to Hunter and told him that if he wants Emily to listen to him the best way is to just agree with her.
She then invited him to join her and her friends, but things do not go well when he accidentally knocks Jade's drink all over her and feeling embarrassed he quickly left.
When he got back to the office Hunter told Emily that he would met Alison and she s nothing like her, also having taken on board what Alison said Hunter told Emily that she was right about changing the name of the paper, and in doing so she started to warm to him.
As Emily and Hunter started working together on the new online "Intruder", he continued to point out every mistake she was making which frustrated her causing her to kick Hunter out of the office so that she could concentrate.
Later, Alison arrived at the office looking for Hunter and Emily told her that she has told him to stay away, when Emily asked what she wanted him for Alison told her that Casey was having a barbecue and she wanted to invite him, but also try to fix him up with Jade which Emily told her was not a great idea as Hunter would not know what to do if he had a girlfriend as she was raised by "cyber wolves in a techno forest".
When Alison found Hunter at Al's she invited him over to Casey but he was quite confused as to why she would want him there, but he turned down the invitation under the impression that Emily would need him to help her, so Alison told him that they would hang out another time; thinking this meant setting a date Hunter asked when but she had to explain that "another" time is only an expression, which again showed how literally Hunter takes everything in life.
Afterwards Hunter went back to Worldwide to see how Emily was getting on and his continued to point out every mistake she made and she had to tell him that in order for her to get it right she would have to figure it all out on her own.
Wanting rid of Hunter again she told him to go to the barbecue that Alison mentioned which at first he was resistant to; however, when she said that if he did not leave one of them would die he quickly changed his mind especially when she told him that Alison had big plans for him.
As Hunter and Alison waited for Casey and Jade to arrive, they started talking and learned that they have quite a bit in common, when Alison suggested that he helped by grilling the meat and he started telling her the scientific effects of grilling which confused her, so she offered him a beer and he told her that he does not drink, and she asked if he does not like putting toxins into his body or if he has a sordid past like she does, when Jade and Casey finally arrived he welcomed them by emptying a bag of candy over her.
As time passed Hunter showed that he is unable to recognize when people are being literal or telling a joke, and once again Jade become his target when he drops her burger on the floor, feeling out of place Hunter quickly makes his exit.
When he got back to the office he found that Emily had successfully formatted a page for the paper and she asked him how things went at the barbecue and he told her not very well.
He then showed his interest in Alison and whether she and Emily have different fathers and she told him that they have different biological fathers and mothers, leading Emily to tell him that Alison is biologically her daughter and she explained how this was possible.
When Alison found that she had taken Emily's MP3 player by mistake she called the office and he told her that it would get him out of the office Emily sent him to Casey's to switch them.
When Casey got a call to go into work, Hunter stayed behind to help her paint.
While Casey was gone Hunter asked Alison out on a date, much to her surprise, and she had to explain that she was dating Casey and it became clear that he had been misreading the signals and he went to leave but he walked into the paint resting on the ladder.
Hunter went back to Worldwide and Emily was shocked to see the state that he was in, and he explained how he asked Alison out but she explained how Alison is seeing Casey, as she started to take Hunter's shirt off he shocked her with a kiss and he explained that he did it because he thought that she was coming on to him in a sexual way when helping him with his shirt later, Alison called to invite Hunter to lunch with her and Casey; however, when he arrived at Al's to see them kissing he decided not to go in and join them.
When Alison graduated from the nursing program, Casey and Emily decide to take her for a dinner, when Emily told Hunter of this he asked if Alison's father had been invited Emily told him that no one had bothered.
Thinking that this was just an oversight Hunter contacted Dr. Larry McDermott and when he told Emily of this she told him that Larry is the last person Alison would want to see.
Hunter later turned up at the Lakeview to stand guard in case Larry decided to turn up, which Emily thought was weird and creepy and said that he has the "intimidation factor of a zygote", when Alison heard Emily telling Hunter to leave she told him to join them but she got a shock when she saw her father standing in the doorway.
Confused as to why Larry was there Alison got upset especially when she learns that Hunter was behind it, when Hunter left the Lakeview he found Alison and Casey in Old Town and tried to apologize but Casey told him to stay away.
Larry later found Hunter at Java and got confused when he started reciting an apology written on a napkin, but he told Hunter that it was not necessary because even though it was not the best idea it did bring him back into his daughter's life, and feeling that it would help Hunter told Larry where he could find Alison.
Having gone back to Worldwide Hunter again started his apology to a stunned Emily who found it to be a joke, seeing that he was sincerely sorry for his actions she told him not to worry, but that changed when she learned that he had sent Larry after Alison.
Emily then called Alison to see how she is and found that Hunter was off the hook as Alison was happy to get the chance to clear the air with Larry, then as Hunter went to leave Emily stopped him and got him to offer her half of his sandwich and told him that there may be hope for him yet.
When Hunter's mother suffered from a stroke it hit him hard and not wanting to go and see his mother alone Alison offered to go with him.
When they got to Chicago, Hunter was worried about what to expect and Alison explained some of the possible symptoms, when the nurse came she told them that only one visitor was allowed at a time.
Hunter later came back and was in a state of shock after his mother told him that the man he always thought to be his father wasn't.
Alison tries to reassure him that maybe the stroke had an effect on her memory, but he couldn't handle it and left.
Back at Java Hunter told Alison about his childhood and how he never really knew his father and about his mother's career.
While hanging out with Alison, Hunter got a call from the home where his mother was staying saying that she was agitated so they headed out to Chicago to see her.
When they got to the home they saw that Aurora (Hunter's mother) was calm and sitting with the nurse, as he approached her she was excited to see him, and asked him to get her out of the home and called him Tristan which confused him and she got upset when he told her that his name wasn't Tristan and she got worse when she saw Alison.
Back at Java, Hunter and Alison discussed why his mother had called him Tristan, and he said that her favorite opera was "Tristan and Isolde", but she suggested that maybe Tristan was a past lover who she kept a secret with and he wondered whether Tristan was his father.
As they try figure it out Alison suggests that they look for his father which he agrees to although he was a bit hesitant to begin with, and he tells her that he’d never met anyone like her before which said was a mutual feeling on her part about him.
When, Hunter finally decided that he was ready to look for his father he ran into an upset Alison in Old Town, but instead of comforting her, he made her feel worse.
Later they decided to go and see Aurora again; however, this time she's calmer and they play her favorite opera on a CD player and asked her about Tristan.
As they talked to her she started to cry and Alison told him not to pressure her, when he decided to leave she told him that his father's information would be on his birth certificate but he told her that he’d never seen it, so they headed to city hall to get a copy of it.
When he got a copy he told her that the name on the certificate for his father wasn’t Jeremiah Hunter the man he thought to be his father but that of a Tristan Wagner, so they decided to look him up.
They later found the address of as Tristan Wagner in Chicago but when they got to his apartment they found that he couldn't possibly be Hunter's father.
Hunter was sitting in Al's when Alison found him and he told that she’d happily continue to find his father and he told her that his mother had died after suffering from another stroke.
Casey later turned up to talk to Alison but she wasn’t that open to listen, and when Hunter stood up to Casey for Alison, Casey lashed out at him.
While Alison went to change her shift at the hospital, Emily and Larry arrived at Al's to talk, when she was finished with Larry Emily went over to talk to Hunter to see if he was going into work and she learned of his mother's passing.
As they spoke Hunter told her of the mystery of his father's identity and of his mother's revelation, and when he told her of the name Tristan on his birth certificate Emily starts to suspect something and asks for Hunter's mother's name.
After Hunter left Al's, Emily found that he’d forgotten an old program from an old performance of Tristan and Isolde and she started to investigate her suspicions, that Larry is Tristan and therefore being Hunter's father she later confronted him at the Lakeview to get some answers.
Alison arrived at Hunter's room, he told her of his anger towards his mother and her revelation, and they got close and ended up kissing, until Alison stops them saying that she's still not over Casey and he's grieving and she told him that sleeping with him was tempting but would have been a mistake.
As Hunter and Alison talked things through Casey turned up and got the wrong end of the stick so Alison, and started to berate Alison for something she hadn’t done and Hunter stood up for her.
Later, Hunter turned up at Worldwide and started packing up his stuff and he told Emily that he's quitting, when he couldn’t find his coffee mug which Emily had taken h decided to leave it behind and she told him to call her before leaving and once he left she phoned her friend at the hospital lab and order a DNA test.
After getting the DNA results, Emily turned up at Hunter's room and told him that he couldn't leave because she had to tell him something important.
As Emily tried desperately to get Hunter to stay in Oakdale he was extremely resistant thinking she only wanted him to stay so that he could help her at "The Intruder", but she told him that it had nothing to do with that and that she's his mother.
Confused at her revelation Hunter takes it hard thinking that she's messing with him to get him to stay, but she explains to him how even though Aurora raised him she wasn't his biological mother, because he's her biological son in the same way that Alison is her biological daughter.
Still not understanding what she was telling him Emily told him how her fertilized eggs were stolen and transferred to the University of Chicago where his mother worked, and she was then implanted with one of the eggs; however, Hunter still chose not to believe what she was saying to him.
As she tried to get Hunter to understand Emily suggested that maybe because of her age Aurora couldn’t get pregnant in the traditional way and knew that Larry could help her but he's confused as to how his mother knew Larry, until Emily told him that Larry admitted being his mother's lover and that his money clip was engraved "To Tristan From Isolde" and he told her of how his mother once called him Tristan after her stroke and she promised to keep his secret forever.
Struggling to accept the news Hunter asked Emily for proof and she gave him the DNA results which confirmed that she's his mother and she tells him that he was a little wrong thinking he had no family in town, because he has her along with his grandmother Susan, his half-brother Daniel.
He then asked her about Alison and said that if Daniel's his half-brother then she must be his half-sister, but Emily explained that she's his sister as they have the same biological parents, which made him feel sick and he quickly left the room leaving a confused Emily behind.
Later, Alison finds Hunter at Java but when she reached out and touched his shoulder he quickly pulled away telling her never to touch him.
He then had to explain to her that nothing could never happen between them because, every time that he's with her the thoughts he has are those that one should never have about their sister, and he was confused to find that she didn’t know what he was talking about.
Hunter then explained to Alison how they have the same biological parents, and they then discovered why they had some special connection, but he felt that he had to leave as the feelings he had for her were too toxic and strong, but she was willing to see where their new sibling relationship lead and that she understood what he was going through as she went through he same thing when she learned that Emily was her biological mother and that it didn’t change how she felt because, Susan was her true mother as she raised her in the same way that Aurora raised him, but was unable to accept it Hunter chose to leave town.
Afterwards, Alison went to see Emily and told her how Hunter thought he was in love with her, much to Emily's horror and she gets even more hurt when Alison tells her how Hunter left, because she wanted a new child and now she learned that she already had one.
Wanting to find some kind of clue as to where Hunter was Emily, went to his room and was shocked to find that Hunter hadn't left but was asleep under a load of clothes in his bed and was a bit worse for wear.
As she tried to help him he told her to stop acting like his mother and she again reiterated how he's stuck with her whether he liked it or not, and he hurts her by saying that even though they have some biological connection he wants nothing to do with her.
Not wanting to pressure Hunter, Emily told him that all she wants is to be a close friend of his, and asked him to go for lunch with her; while she waited for him to get ready Emily phoned Alison to come with them along with Susan.
Later Emily and Hunter head to the Lakeview to meet Susan and first Susan thought that Emily was repeating her mistake with Casey, until Emily explained how Hunter is her son because one of her fertilized eggs was given to Hunter's mother.
When Alison arrived along with Larry, Susan gets confused as to why the latest family revelation concerned him and is shocked and angered when she learns that he's Hunter's biological father, especially as everything happened when he was still married to her.
When Larry told Hunter that he would like to be a father to him, he got upset and left telling them all, that he doesn’t want anything to do with them and Alison followed him out.
When she caught up with him in Old Town, and she tells him that he shouldn’t run away from his newfound family and that they should accept their new relationship and that she's ready to have a brother in her life and how Emily and Susan are always there when you need them.
Later they went back to the Lakeview and they see that Larry's gone after literally being kicked out by Susan, but Emily says that they should focus on the fact that Hunter's now officially a part of the Stewart family but he told her not to push it.
After finishing lunch Hunter tells Alison that it may be awhile before he can consider them all family but she tells him that despite the Stewarts' reputation in Oakdale they’re not that bad, and she told him that they don't take being alone lightly in the family so he should just get used to it.
When Riley (Adam) turned up at the Lakeview he initially thinks that she and Hunter are together, but she explains that he's really her brother.
He asked her whether Casey knew as it would help them because he can’t be jealous of Hunter if he's her brother but she says that it won’t change anything.
Casey later turned up at Memorial after learning of Alison and Hunter's new connection but he failed to apologise in an appropriate way and Hunter told him to take a hint as Alison didn’t need him in her life.
After, Alison explained to Casey that they had broken up when he walked into Hunter's room, and she told him that she doesn’t need him in her life.
After cutting her ties with Casey, Hunter tried to comfort Alison but when he put his arm around her things got extremely awkward and he left.
While Hunter was formatting pages on the website he was shocked to see Larry enter the office to see him, and he offers to give Hunter something of his mother's but Emily arrives before he can answer.
When Emily started berating Larry and telling him to stay away from her family Hunter, told her that he didn’t need her to defend him.
Hunter then accepted the gift Larry had which was an old music box of his mother's, Emily then told him to leave and Hunter agreed.
After, Hunter decided to stay busy with work but got upset when he thought of how his mother kept everything special to her from him, and Emily told her that he is not alone as he has family, but he continued to reject her as his mother.
Hunter then went to find Alison at Memorial and invited her to lunch but she told him that she is going to Casey's party which he doesn’t take well as he doesn’t understand why it's still important to her; in the end to help her Hunter decided to go to the party with her.
When they got to party Margo and everyone else were wondering how Alison knew Hunter and he explained how he's her brother much to everyone's amazement, especially Lisa who wondered how Susan could have a child that no one knew about, so Alison and Hunter explain about the situation with the stolen fertilized eggs, which made Larry his biological father and Emily his biological mother.
After Tom told Hunter that he should meet his half-brother Daniel, and without knowing the details Hunter asks Tom if he was married to Emily much to Margo's horror and when he asked how he could have a child with Emily not having been married to her things get a bit awkward.
When Casey arrived and saw that Alison has come he was happy to see her and to help them Adam distracted Hunter to give them time alone, when they went outside Hunter continued to spy on them and got agitated when he saw them getting close, he then told her that it was time to leave but she chose to stay behind with Casey so he left alone.
Emily later found Hunter at the office and tried to talk to him about his grief and how it's hard for everyone but that you have to move on in time, and she told him how she's not trying to replace his mother and that even if they couldn’t be family that maybe they could be good friends and see how things go, but he doesn’t give her an answer.
At the office, Emily told Hunter that was working on a story but was going to get some breakfast and he wondered why she was always trying to feed him but she offered to go for a working breakfast with him, but he said that he had to take care of his mother's ashes and she got a strange feeling knowing that his mother was in the office and she told him to figure something out as it was too crowded for the three of them.
While he was working Lucinda turned up at the office looking for Emily and he told her his plans for "The Intruder".
Later Hunter went to find Emily at Al's as she was talking to Paul to tell her that Lucinda was looking for her.
When Emily finds Lucinda she was shocked to learn that her job was no longer available and that Hunter would be taking over, which she saw as a way of him putting her in her place, and she told him that if her didn't want her to be his mom that was fine but he didn't have to get her fired.
When Emily walked out of the office Lucinda told Hunter to let her go and he berated her for firing Emily as she is "The Intruder" which Lucinda failed to acknowledge, and even though he loved his job, in support of Emily, Hunter quit.

(Lucius) Valerius Maximus (Basilius) (fl. 4th century) was a Roman senator who was appointed consul in AD 327.
Valerius Maximus was a member of the fourth century patrician gens Valeria, and probably the son of Valerius Maximus Basilius, urban prefect of Rome in 319.
He served as the "Vicarius Orientis" in AD 325 before being appointed the eastern Praetorian prefect, probably in late 326, when the emperor Constantine I returned from Italy.
This was an unusual appointment, as the office of Praetorian prefect was reserved for members of the Equestrian order, not senators, and it displayed the emperor’s confidence in Valerius Maximus, allowing him to exercise command over the extensive resources of the east.
He continued to serve Constantine in this role throughout 327 and 328, relinquishing the office in early 329 after Constantine returned from Gaul.
During this period, in AD 327, Valerius Maximus was appointed "consul posterior", alongside Flavius Constantius.
Then in late AD 331, he was probably sent to Gaul with the "Caesar" Constantius II, serving as Constantius’ Praetorian Prefect.
Valerius Maximus served him there until late 333 or early 334, when Constantius returned to his father’s court at Constantinople.
In around AD 336, Valerius Maximus was appointed Praetorian Prefect for a third time, this time accompanying the "Caesar" Dalmatius to the provinces along the Danubian frontier, which had been assigned to him as the territory he was to manage, in Constantine’s planned administrative division of the empire.
He served under Dalmatius until 337, when Valerius Maximus was replaced shortly before the murder of Dalmatius in the wake of the death of Constantine I.
It is speculated that Valerius Maximus was married twice.
They possibly had one son together, named Lucius Valerius Septimius Bassus.
It has been postulated that they had two children, a son, Valerius Maximus Basilius, and a daughter, Valeria, who may have become a Christian through her possible marriage to a Rufius Maecius Placidus.
The Lauenburg Lakes Nature Park  was founded in 1961 and lies in the district of Lauenburg in the southeastern part of the German state of Schleswig-Holstein.
It is right on the border with the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in the Schleswig-Holstein Uplands, a Young Drift moraine landscape that formed during the Weichselian glaciation of the last ice age.
With an area of over 470 km the nature park is the third largest in Schleswig-Holstein and contains extensive stretches of forest.
The Lauenburg Lakes Nature Park, there are 40 lakes in total, borders directly on the Mecklenburg biosphere reserve of Schaalsee and, together, they form a large nature reserve along the former Inner German Border.
The largest lakes in the nature park are the Ratzeburger See and the Schaalsee, which are linked together by the Schaalsee Canal that begins near Salem.
The Old Salt Road from Lüneburg to Lübeck runs through the nature park – at several places, such as Fredeburg, still as a medieval route - the Alte Salzstraße.
The nature park is roughly bordered to the west between Berkenthin and Büchen by the Elbe-Lübeck Canal.
The Naturparkweg nature trail runs through the park and links it to the other four nature parks in Schleswig-Holstein.
The watershed between the North and Baltic Seas also runs through the nature park.
The United States' Federal Bureau of Investigation instituted an Honorary Medals Program in 1989 as a way of recognizing "exceptional acts" by FBI employees and other law enforcement personnel working with the FBI.
These medals were created to supplement the then-existing reward system within the Bureau.
There are four medals in the program intended for personnel: the FBI Star, the FBI Medal for Meritorious Achievement, the FBI Shield of Bravery, and the FBI Medal of Valor.
One additional medal, the FBI Memorial Star, is for a surviving relative when a death has occurred in the line of duty.
These medals are considered to be among the highest honors granted by the FBI, and fewer than 400 had been awarded as of March 2009.
"The FBI Star is awarded for serious injury sustained in the direct line of duty from physical confrontation with criminal adversaries, an injury inflicted by weapons, gunshot wounds inflicted in the line of duty, or an injury so severe that it would require substantial emergency room sutures, hospitalization, or comprehensive medical treatment for a sustained period of time."
One recipient of the FBI Star is Major Peter Norton of the British Army, who was severely injured when he triggered a secondary explosive device while attempting to clear an area where five American soldiers had been killed by a roadside bomb.
Norton was also awarded the George Cross—the highest British award for acts of gallantry which did not take place in action directly against enemy forces, and also awarded for civilian gallantry—for this incident.
"The FBI Medal for Meritorious Achievement is awarded for extraordinary and exceptional meritorious service in a duty of extreme challenge and great responsibility, extraordinary and exceptional achievements in connection with criminal or national security cases or projects, or a decisive, exemplary act that results in the protection or the direct saving of life in severe jeopardy in the line of duty."
Supervisory Special Agent Harold Bickmore of the FBI was awarded the Medal for Meritorious Achievement for saving the life of a sixteen-year-old girl whom he found on the ground not breathing at the scene of a traffic accident on a major four-lane highway.
He administered first aid on the spot, including CPR without any protection from blood-borne disease.
"The FBI Shield of Bravery is presented for brave and courageous acts occurring in the line of duty or within the scope of FBI employment which may extend to major assistance to a task force or undercover operation, grave situations, or crisis confrontations associated with the highest priority cases of the FBI."
Shields of Bravery were awarded to Special Agent Ronald Eowan Sr, Regional Security Officer Earl Miller of the State Department, and former Special Agent Paul Myers.
They spent nearly four years in Indonesia under primitive conditions orchestrating a "highly complex ruse" that led to the arrests of 12 terrorists and the disruption of their network.
"The FBI Medal of Valor is presented in recognition of an exceptional act of heroism or voluntary risk of personal safety and life, and this act must have occurred in the direct line of duty or within the scope of FBI employment and in the face of criminal adversaries."
Special Agent Robert Merta was grazed by a bullet when he tackled a fugitive prison escapee who had drawn his gun on Merta and three other agents when they tried to arrest him.
Merta received the Medal of Valor for risking his life to protect his fellow agents.
"The FBI Memorial Star is presented to a surviving relative where death has occurred in the line of duty as the direct result of an adversarial action."
The family of Special Agent Paul M. Sorce, who died as a result of an auto accident in the line of duty, was given a Memorial Star.
First publicized in the 1990s, it has not been used enough to have gained a fully established profile.
RTI-51 can be expected to have properties lying somewhere in between RTI-31 and RTI-55.
Importantly it has a ratio of monoamine reuptake inhibition of D > S > N (1.8:10.6:37.4nM respectively) which is an unusual balance of effects not produced by other commonly used compounds (although RTI-121 is similar, but more DAT selective).
It has been used in its Br radiolabelled form to map the distribution of dopamine transporters in the brain.
Modern research seems to confirm the above hypothesis.
However, earlier work produced more scattered results.
Based upon what is obvious from the table, RTI-31, RTI-51, and RTI-55 are all similarly potent TRIs.
More recent work has advocated using cloned human transporter/s.
Between 1982–1994, American radio and media personality Howard Stern hosted a number of pay-per-view specials and released various VHS and audio tapes.
Howard Stern's U.S. Open Sores was an event that occurred at the Nassau Coliseum, Uniondale, New York in front of a sold-out attendance of 16,000.
Taking place on October 7, 1989, the main event featured a tennis match between Howard Stern and his radio show producer Gary Dell'Abate.
The event sold out in four hours, with each ticket costing $22.50.
Other suggested event titles included "The Bush Open", "U.S. Open Legs", "U.S. Open Beaver" and "U.S. Beaver Open".
The event was later released on VHS via mail order.
A documentary crew shot behind-the-scenes footage including interviews with participants and guests creating a 105-minute program.
Butt Bongo Fiesta is a VHS of a special hosted by Howard Stern.
Released in late 1992, the tape features "Jungle Man," a segment filmed for 3-D viewing, with each original tape being supplied with two 3-D viewing glasses.
The Miss Howard Stern New Year's Eve Pageant (later released as Howard Stern's New Year's Rotten Eve 1994; a send off to "Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve") was a two-hour pay-per-view special that aired on New Year's Eve 1993 and New Year's Day 1994, hosted by Howard Stern.
Included in the special were parodies of Michael Jackson and Jerry Seinfeld, a song by Gary Dell'Abate (Stern's radio show Executive Producer) called "Doing the Baba Booey," and a mock beauty pageant resulting in the crowning of the show's first "Miss Howard Stern."
Judges for the pageant included Janis Ian, Daniel Carver, John Bobbitt, Sherman Hemsley, Mark Hamill, Tiny Tim and Joe Frazier.
More than 40 women (and one man) participated in the pageant, most of whom were winners from preliminary contests held in cities where the radio show was being syndicated at the time.
The field, which was narrowed down to 20, competed in the lingerie and talent rounds.
Five finalists were announced and after an interview round, the runners-up and winner were announced.
During the pageant, there were many sentiments made among the contestants about favoritism given to certain girls, notably Debbie Tay, because they were hand-picked by Stern on his radio show, therefore given more attention and exposure.
The special was available for order on VHS videotape, and came packaged with a limited edition Leroy Neiman lithograph of Howard.
Released on February 25, 1997, the 29-track album features two that Stern himself provides lyrics, performing with Rob Zombie and The Dust Brothers.
In 1997, the album was certified platinum for shipping 1,000,000 copies.
When this year’s round of unsuspecting Northerners fail to show up for their annual Guts N’ Glory Jubilee because the Feds are investigating the disappearances of Northerners over the years, the residents of Pleasant Valley take their twisted carnival on the road and head to Iowa, where they encounter spoiled heiresses, Rome and Tina Sheraton, and the cast and crew of their “Road Rascals” reality show.
They begin killing the cast and crew.
At the end, the residents of Pleasant Valley get an idea to use a TV commercial to lure in their victims.
Unlike the first film Raw Nerve was not involved with the production.

The West Coast release is set for the July 17, 2010.
The New Jersey release on July 17, 2010 was hosted by Tim Sullivan.
Scott Weinberg of Fearnet called it "a merciless chore to get through."
R. L. Shaffer of IGN rated it 3/10 stars and called it derivative and dull.
David Harley of Bloody Disgusting rated it 0.5/5 stars and described it as "a film which makes absolutely no sense, has no real plot, and is peppered with jokes that seem to be going for being merely crude and offensive rather than funny."
It was described by Schrank in 1802.
It is mainly found in Northern and parts of Central Europe and in isolated populations in Southern and South-Eastern Europe.
In the North its range extends to the polar regions and in the South it is found up to the Alps.
Its Eastern range extends through Central and North Russia up to the Ural, through Siberia up to the Yenisei River.
The moth flies from May to July in the warmer regions and from June to August in Northern Europe.
The larva preferably feeds on "Vaccinium myrtillus", "Vaccinium uliginosum", "Calluna vulgaris", "Lathyrus niger", "Salix repens" and "Erica".
Less frequent, they have also been recorded on "Lonicera tatarica", "Stellaria", "Polygonum aviculare", "Fragaria vesca", "Lactuca sativa" and "Taraxacum officinale".
Archer is an American adult animated sitcom created by Adam Reed for the basic cable network FX.
It follows the exploits of a dysfunctional group of secret agents—Sterling Archer (voiced by H. Jon Benjamin) and seven of his colleagues—Malory Archer (Jessica Walter), Lana Kane (Aisha Tyler), Cheryl Tunt (Judy Greer), Pam Poovey (Amber Nash), Ray Gillette (Adam Reed), Cyril Figgis (Chris Parnell) and Dr. Algernop Krieger (Lucky Yates).
The premise of "Archer" evolves in subsequent seasons as the show experiments with the standard setup of an anthology, each with self-contained arcs, new settings, a disparate set of personae for each character, even distinct humor.
Beginning with the eighth season in 2017, the series moved to the FXX network.
"Archer" was conceived by Reed shortly after the cancellation of his Adult Swim comedy "Frisky Dingo".
It draws inspiration from a variety of sources, including the "James Bond" franchise.
The show's hallmarks include reference-heavy humor, rapid-fire dialogue, and meta-comedy.
"Archer" is produced using limited animation and takes its visual style from mid-century comic art.
The cast members record their lines individually, and the show regularly employs guest actors and actresses for supporting characters.
There have been 101 episodes broadcast in the show's history.
"Archer" has received positive reviews from critics and won awards, including three Primetime Emmy Awards and four Critics Choice Awards.
The series has also received 15 Annie Award nominations, among others, for outstanding achievement in animation, writing, direction, and voice acting.
At San Diego Comic-Con 2018, it was announced the tenth season will be titled "Archer: 1999".
Reed intends to leave "Archer" after its tenth season, although plans have not yet been finalized for the show's future.
"Archer" follows the exploits of eight dysfunctional secret agents of the International Secret Intelligence Service (ISIS), a fictional New York-based intelligence agency.
They are Sterling Archer, the show's narcissistic, womanizing protagonist; Malory Archer, the retired agent-turned-ISIS director and Sterling's snarky, emotionally distant mother; Lana Kane, Sterling's love interest and mother of his infant daughter, and by far the most professional field agent at ISIS; Ray Gillette, the agency's openly gay bomb specialist; Pam Poovey, the head of the agency's Human Resources department who is often ridiculed by her peers; Cyril Figgis, a mild-mannered accountant-turned-agent; Cheryl Tunt, Malory's delusional, psychotic personal assistant; and Dr. Algernop Krieger, a bizarre, morally bankrupt scientist with little regard for the well-being of his subjects.
The show features an array of supporting characters, several of whom gained expanded roles in subsequent episodes.
Major supporting roles in "Archer" include Slater, an arms dealer and agent for the CIA; Katya Kazanova, head of the KGB and Sterling's former love interest; and Barry Dylan, Sterling's archnemesis, who vows to kill him.
This, according to art director Neal Holman, allowed producers the freedom to "cherry pick the stuff [they] like and ignore the elements that [they] don't."
Yet in "Archer" subsequent years, Reed developed new settings and character arcs, often with self-contained stories, as he explored new concepts for the comedy, much like an anthology.
These seasons see the group attempt to complete a number of laborious tasks in highly unusual circumstances, generally to no avail, that involve sustaining an illegal cocaine operation to keep afloat, contract work for the CIA, and running a private, Los Angeles-based detective agency after being blacklisted from espionage by the US government.
The show's eighth season, "Archer Dreamland", transpires in Sterling's subconscious, re-imagining the core cast as stock characters from a Gangland-era noir film set in 1947 Los Angeles.
The ninth season, "", continues this arc as the characters are again re-envisioned as inhabitants of a remote South Pacific island circa 1939.
The tenth season will be set in Archer's subconscious version of space.
According to Reed, it will be a "1970s vision of the future" with nods to the "prevalent aesthetic at the time", featuring "floppy disks instead of holograms", and "xenomorphs" of some description.
The cable television network Comedy Central has exclusive US broadcast syndication rights for "Archer".
The terms of the deal cover the show's existing content and a commitment for future seasons.
Comedy Central began airing the series on their network on March 2, 2015, in one-hour program time slots.
In the United Kingdom, Viceland owns exclusive cable syndication rights for "Archer"s first five seasons.
In Canada, the show is syndicated nationally on Teletoon at Night, and new episodes are aired in tandem with the American broadcast.
In 2014, Amazon Prime and Hulu purchased online streaming rights to "Archer" as part of multiyear licensing agreements with 20th Television.
Beginning in 2018, Hulu retains exclusive streaming rights to the show under a new licensing agreement with 20th Century Fox.
Before the creation of "Archer", Adam Reed worked on animated comedies with executive producer and longtime collaborator Matt Thompson.
The pair became renowned for their work on a number of Adult Swim television projects, chiefly "Sealab 2021" and their follow-up "Frisky Dingo", which aired for several years.
After the cancellation of "Frisky Dingo" in 2008, Reed took a vacation to Spain to brainstorm ideas for a new project.
His experience traversing the Vía de la Plata, and people watching in Plaza Mayor in nearby Salamanca, enabled him to conceptualize his vision of "Archer".
Reed recalled in an interview, "So I sat on the Plaza Mayor for three days—drinking either coffee or beer or gin, depending on the time of day—surrounded by these Spanish women who seemed both unaware and completely aware of their beauty.
And for three days, I couldn't even splutter "Buenos dias" to any of them—not once.
And thus was Sterling Archer born—he would've absolutely sauntered over to a table full of those women and sat down and ordered an entire case of cava or whatever."
Nevertheless, he believed developing a sitcom with the theme of global espionage was inevitable given his proclivity for adventure-driven comedy.
The "James Bond" franchise, "" (2006), and "The Pink Panther" franchise were Reed's inspiration as the series, then under the working title "Duchess", began taking definite form.
By August 18, 2009, following Reed's pitch to FX, the network commissioned six episodes for "Archer".
FX initially commissioned the project as a companion series for their situational comedy "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia", but the network ultimately delayed "Archer" premiere to the following January because of the demanding production schedule, and "The League" became "Philadelphia" companion show instead.
Despite this, the pilot, "Mole Hunt", aired as a test screening on September 17, 2009, following the season five premiere of "Philadelphia".
The pilot was not featured in program listings or otherwise promoted by FX; rather the network merely informed select television critics of the broadcast.
FX moved "Archer" to FXX's broadcast lineup in 2017 as part of an aggressive strategy to increase the network's output of animated programming.
FX had planned the move before the show's seventh season, in conjunction with the debut of "Cassius and Clay", but decided against it after "Clay" abrupt cancellation.
The ninth season premiered on April 25, 2018.
Reed intends to conclude "Archer" after its tenth season, although plans have not yet been finalized according to a 2018 interview with IndieWire.
Scriptwriting an episode consumes three weeks of the production schedule.
As the comedy's main writer, Reed typically creates the first draft during pre-production, which he submits to his team of producers and art directors.
From there, they analyze the script for each character, cast guest stars, and create basic concept designs, before Reed develops a final script to submit to FXX.
A typical "Archer" episode goes through a page of dialogue per minute.
"Archer" uses the standard setup of a workplace comedy, where "subversively unlikeable" characters play off bawdy, reference-heavy humor, rapid-fire dialogue, and interaction-based drama.
By the end of the fourth season, however, Reed questioned the longevity of the comedy's spy premise and began contemplating a new direction for "Archer", partly inspired by the then-growing associations of ISIS with the identically initialled fundamentalist Salafi jihadist group.
Newer seasons experiment with the standard format of an anthology, each with their own self-contained arc, new settings, a disparate set of personae for each character, even distinct humor.
Reed said, "Once we started making them, and having a good time making them, [we thought] 'what are some other things we can do now that the boundaries have sort of been passed?'"
Cultural references on "Archer" cover a wide spectrum of society and the human condition, in film, literature and music for example.
Some—chiefly references to literature—are obscure, and the audience often may not notice them in a single viewing.
Reed cites his time as a university English major as the primary forebear for the show's literary references.
"Archer" also develops a unique self-referentiality through character-based jokes, catchphrases, and running gags that evolve over multiple episodes.
For example, Sterling or another character may yell "phrasing" in response to any sexually suggestive remark.
Neil Genzlinger of "The New York Times" argues that "Archer" uses "a caustic brand of humor that isn't for everybody but that has brought the show a dedicated fan base."
Line work is pronounced by thick, bold outlines, in contrast to the very fine, thin line work characteristic of prime time comedies such as "The Simpsons" and "Family Guy".
Production of the comedy involves a workforce of 150 crew members from Reed and Thompson's Atlanta-based company Floyd County Productions, quadrupling the number that worked on its freshman season.
"Archer"s production process uses Adobe software—Photoshop, Illustrator, and After Effects—as well as visual effects programs such as Toon Boom Harmony and Cinema 4D for compositing and animation.
This begins via storyboarding, typically after a script has been approved, and lasts around 11–13 weeks per episode.
Four episodes are produced in tandem at any given session, generally in staggered phases.
In the initial stages of animation, art director Chad Hurd and producer Neal Holman storyboard set pieces with a team of artists based on specifications in the script.
After a series of design revisions and reviews, these skeletal designs are then rendered as 3D models in Autodesk 3ds Max, employing a variety of animation and special effects techniques.
The illustration team takes various screenshots of the 3D models once they have been completed, and the resulting images are enhanced by specialized artists in After Effects.
The characters are composed in Illustrator using referential material, among them photos of models and actors in costume.
Because "Archer" is produced using limited animation, characters are rendered as digital puppets, and not hand-drawn on paper and digitally composited for traditional cel animation.
Costumes may or may not be reproduced depending on their animatability; too much detail can hurt a character's animatability.
These body pieces are then separated into basic components and layers, much like an action figure, and rigged in After Effects.
Consequently, one given pose can turn into a range of others, which, according to producer Bryan Fordney, creates "the illusion of more animation on screen than what is actually present."
A similar technique is used in the animation of a character's face—head illustrations are divided into basic components that can be turned "off" and "on" in sequence, lending the appearance of facial movement and expression.
Source code is often implemented to ensure better automation and a more fluid range of motion.
Once compositing begins, compositors enhance the visual palette of artwork from three or four departments until it "looks like it was made by a single artist."
For elaborate scenes like action sequences, artists develop several composites, which are then superimposed on stock footage using special effects.
Holman cited "Catch Me If You Can" (2002), "The Incredibles" (2004), "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" (2006), and the work of Saul Bass as strong stylistic influences in the creation of "Archer" title sequence.
When he was developing the original sequence, the rough draft version consisted of style frames with roiling flame silhouettes of the characters coalesced on a charred, black background.
The crew initially struggled to develop an opening theme they believed was compatible with the premise of "Archer", but once the show's eponymous theme song had been completed, Holman felt his idea was too melodramatic and went in a different direction.
He created the finalized version of the sequence from several segments, each reviewed by the producers, because of the demanding production schedule.
The standard opening of "Archer" has gone through six iterations—a replacement of shots at the start of the show's sixth season, and brand new sequences for its fifth, seventh, eighth and ninth seasons.
"Archer" did not employ a composer to develop a soundtrack in its first four seasons, but instead used a compilation of needle drop stock music.
By season five, musician JG Thirlwell was hired as the composer for the comedy's jazz-influenced score, brought to the producers' attention for his work on "The Venture Bros.".
Benjamin voices the show's titular character, Walter voices Malory Archer, Tyler plays Lana Kane, Greer portrays Cheryl Tunt, Nash plays Pam Poovey, Parnell voices Cyril Figgis, Yates portrays Dr. Algernop Krieger, and Reed plays Ray Gillette.
Reed was expected to play the titular role in the original pilot, but was recast because producers felt his voice-over did not serve the character's dialogue well.
When Benjamin received the offer, he was surprised since he did not believe his voice was suitable for the part.
At one point, Benjamin used a British accent for the character, but Reed insisted he use his normal speaking voice.
Producers contracted her shortly after they sent out character descriptions to talent agencies, and they promoted her involvement to recruit actors for the project.
Greer agreed to "Archer" because of her wish to break into voice acting, although she initially believed the series was too provocative for network TV.
Nash did not audition for her part, rather the actress was approached by Reed and Thompson, whom she had previously collaborated with in "Frisky Dingo", while she was recording DVD extras for their program.
Yates was brought onto "Archer" at Nash's request, after Krieger was given a more prominent speaking role.
In addition to the main cast, episodes often feature guest voices from a range of professions.
Major supporting roles in "Archer" are played by George Coe (until his death in 2015), Jeffrey Tambor, Christian Slater, Jon Hamm, Allison Tolman, Dave Willis, Ona Grauer, Keegan-Michael Key, Bryan Cranston, and J.K. Simmons, among others.
Some stars appear as themselves, or portray fictionalized caricatures of themselves, such as Slater, Kenny Loggins, as well as the late Anthony Bourdain and Burt Reynolds.
"Archer" cast members record their lines individually rather than at group recording sessions to accommodate their work schedules.
The producers therefore do not host table reads or rehearsals.
Recording sessions can take place anywhere, but are typically held at studios in Atlanta, Los Angeles, and New York, depending on the actor's home base.
"Archer" has been well received by the media.
A number of TV critics have complimented the work of the voice actors, often singling out Benjamin for further praise: Tim Goodman from "The Hollywood Reporter", for example, viewed Benjamin's acting as the bedrock of "Archer", "mixing rants, mumbling, whining and a stop-and-start delivery style that is note-perfect for comedy."
Other reviewers cited the writing, the crude sensibility, and characterization among the show's most satisfying attributes: the main characters have been described as "exceedingly well-defined."
Chris Barton of the "Los Angeles Times" called "Archer" "the smartest, strangest animated show on TV this side of "Rick and Morty"," and "Entertainment Weekly" journalist Ken Tucker praised the series for its "solid plotting, vividly distinct characters, and some of the most unexpected punchlines and sight-gags in prime time."
"Archer" willingness to experiment with anthologized tropes is a principal topic of discussion among critics.
Some journalists felt these arcs provide the show greater creative license to explore deeper within itself.
While the comedy received positive feedback for staying true to form "in the service of something much grimier and at once totally fresh" in early seasons, later "Archer" episodes have been subjected to criticism as the tone and emphasis of the show evolves.
By the eighth and ninth seasons, some critics believed that despite having greater visual appeal, "Archer" too often sacrifices narrative continuity and humor through increasingly predictable and uninspired writing.
The series has been included on a number of best of lists.
"TV Guide" ranked "Archer" among the 60 greatest TV cartoons of all time, and the show placed within the top ten on "Entertainment Weekly" 25 Greatest Animated TV Series.
Similarly, "The New Yorker", in a non-ranked rundown of 2014's most noteworthy programs, called "Archer" "good counter-programming for every horrible thing in the news."
"Archer" success allowed the ensemble to embark on a nationwide tour, "Archer Live!"
, where the actors performed scenes from the show's repertoire.
The tour commenced with shows in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Philadelphia, and New York—sporadic dates were later added to the itinerary.
Live readings may also be held at promotional events such as the San Diego Comic-Con International.
FX released "Cherlene (Songs from the Series Archer)", a compilation of country music, on March 3, 2014, through digital media.
The album features a cover of "Danger Zone", with guest vocals by Kenny Loggins, as well as three original tracks composed by Aaron Lee Tasjan.
Kevn Kinney, frontman of Drivin N Cryin, led music production of "Cherlene".
Kinney had met Adam Reed a decade earlier, and was hired after a lunch meeting with the writer and Matt Thompson in Atlanta.
In preparation for his services, Kinney viewed "Archer" first three seasons to familiarize himself with Cheryl Tunt—the eponymous character of "Cherlene".
The album was recorded at Griffin Mastering, Inc. with a group that included Tasjan, David Franklin, and Drivin N Cryin member Dave V. Johnson on instrumentation.
Jessy Lynn Martens provided Cheryl's singing voice, chosen because of her subdued Southern accent and likeness to Judy Greer's voice.
"Cherlene" received positive reviews and peaked at number 68 on iTunes' best-selling albums chart.
In June 2016, Thompson and executive producer Casey Willis discussed the possibility of a feature-length "Archer" film with "The Daily Beast".
According to Thompson, this discussion happens "once every two years" among Reed and the producers, although work on the project would likely not begin until after the show ends.
As well, they cited Jon Hamm as their ideal choice of actor to portray Sterling if it's commissioned as a live-action adaptation.
Karen Burke (born 14 July 1971) is an English footballer.
She most recently played for Blackburn Rovers Ladies.
Burke was born in Liverpool and represented England at full international level.
Burke only took up football aged 21, with a spell at St. Helens.
In 1994 she reached her first FA Women's Cup final with Knowsley United.
Burke hit the crossbar in injury–time as Knowsley lost 1–0 to Doncaster Belles.
In the following year's final, with Knowsley now known as Liverpool Ladies, player–of–the–match Burke twice put them ahead against Arsenal, only for Marieanne Spacey to seal a 3–2 win for The Gunners.
In summer 1995 Burke agreed to join Everton Ladies, but changed her mind when Liverpool appointed John Bennison — a professional coach from the Liverpool F.C. "Boot Room".
In April 1996 Burke lost her third consecutive FA Women's Cup final to Croydon, on penalties after a 1–1 draw at The New Den.
Luckless Burke had given Liverpool the lead and converted her penalty in the shoot–out.
She finally joined Everton Ladies in the 1997 close season and won the Premier League title in 1997–1998.
She played in Iceland in summer 1998, 1999 and 2000, with ÍBV.
In 2000 Burke and team–mate Becky Easton joined Doncaster Belles.
Burke would travel twice weekly to Doncaster from her base in Liverpool, where she worked in a pub.
The 2002 FA Women's Cup Final was Burke's fourth unsuccessful appearance, as Doncaster were beaten 2–1 by the full–time professionals of Fulham.
Burke moved to Leeds United Ladies for 2002–2003 before spending the 2003 close season back with Icelandic side ÍBV.
She returned to Doncaster Belles for 2003–2004, before joining an exodus of players brought about by a cash–crisis and moving back to Leeds, via another stint at ÍBV.
Burke then suffered more FA Women's Cup final disappointment with Leeds United Ladies, in their 5–0 defeat against Arsenal in 2006.
Burke left Leeds to join Blackburn Rovers Ladies in the 2007 close season.
Although signed as an attacking midfielder, she moved to right–back for the 2009–10 season.
Burke has won over 50 caps for the England senior team.

The Xiaohe (Little River) Cemetery , also known as Ördek’s Necropolis, refers to a bronze-age burial site located near the dried out Lop Nur Lake, in Xinjiang, Western China.
It is an oblong sand dune, from which more than 30 well-preserved mummies, buried in air-tight ox-hide bags, have been excavated.
The mummies, the earliest of which date from around 4000 years ago, appear Caucasoid.
Genetic analysis, however, revealed an admixture of population from both the West and East, with paternal lineages being exclusively west Eurasian, and maternal lineages - a mixture of east and west Eurasian.
The entire Xiaohe Tomb complex contains about 330 tombs, about 160 of which have been looted by grave robbers.
The Xiaohe remains contains the largest number of mummies found at any single site in the world to date.
No human settlement has been found near the tomb complex; the bodies were therefore likely to have been transported from elsewhere for burial at this site.
A local hunter named Ördek found the site around 1910.
Later, in 1934, partly with Ördek's help, Swedish explorer and archeologist Folke Bergman located the site which he named Ördek’s Necropolis.
The tomb complex appeared as a small oval mound, and the top of the burial mound was covered with a forest of erect wooden posts whose tops had been splintered by strong winds.
Oar-shaped wooden monuments and wooden human figures were found at the site.
The coffins were assembled over the bodies which had become mummified.
Bergman excavated 12 burials and recovered approximately 200 artifacts that were transported back to Stockholm.
Bergman noted the surprising resemblance in the clothing, especially the fringed loin-cloths, to Bronze Age grave finds in Denmark, but dismissed any direct connection.
In October 2003, an excavation project, organized by the Xinjiang Cultural Relics and Archaeology Institute, began at the site.
A total of 167 tombs have been uncovered since the end of 2002, and excavations have revealed hundreds of smaller tombs built in layers.
In 2006, a coffin wrapped with ox hide in the shape of a boat was found.
It contained a remarkably intact mummy of a young woman, which came to be called the Beauty of Xiaohe.
Each tomb is marked by a vertical poplar post near the upper end of the coffin.
A skull or horn of an ox may be suspended from the post.
The ends of the posts can be either torpedo-shaped or oar-shaped, representing the phallus and vulva respectively.
The male burials were marked with the oar-shaped posts, while the female burials were marked with the phallic posts.
Bows and arrows were found with the male burials.
The posts and coffins may be painted red.
Each coffin is made of two massive pieces of plank assembled over the body, resembling an overturned boat, and then covered with cowhides.
A few special tombs containing females have an extra rectangular coffin on top covered with layers of mud.
Small masks of human faces and wooden human figures may accompany the burials.
Twigs and branches of ephedra were placed beside the body.
In years 2009–2015, the remains of in total 92 individuals found at the Xiaohe Tomb complex were analyzed for Y-DNA and mtDNA markers.
Genetic analyses of the mummies showed that the maternal lineages of the Xiaohe people originated from both East Asia and West Eurasia, whereas the paternal lineages all originated from West Eurasia.
Mitochondrial DNA analysis, which reveals the maternal ancestry, showed that maternal lineages carried by the Xiaohe people included West Eurasian haplogroups H, K, U5, U7, U2e, T and R*; East Asian haplogroups B5, D and G2a; haplogroups of most likely Central Asian or Siberian origin C4 and C5; as well as typically South Asian haplogroups M5 and M*.
On the other hand, nearly all (11 out of 12 - or around 92%) of surveyed paternal lines were of West Eurasian haplogroup R1a1, and one was of exceptionally rare basal paragroup K*.
According to a comment posted on 18 July 2014 by Hui Zhou, one of study's co-authors, Xiaohe R1a1 lineages belonged to a specifically European branch rather than the more common Central Asian R-Z93.
Richard Hurlin (born 14 January 1984 in Cardiff) is a Welsh footballer, who plays for Peninsula Power Football Club.
He started his career with Cardiff City FC as a youth player but would later sign for his home town team Llanelli AFC in the summer of 2001.
After impressing in his first season in the Welsh Premier League he signed for title chasers Cwmbran Town AFC in the 2003 January transfer window where he would spend the next three seasons.
During his time at Cwmbran, Richard attracted interest from a number of football league clubs and after an unsuccessful trial at Nottingham Forest F.C. he spent 3 months with Swansea City A.F.C. where he was on the verge of signing until Manager Nick Cusack was released from his coaching position and the deal fell through.
Richard would stay with Cwmbran until March 2005, during which time he enjoyed great success with the club, one which gave him the opportunity to play against Israel giants Maccabi Haifa in the UEFA cup 1st qualifying stage, losing 6-0 on aggregate.
His time at Cwmbran also saw him score the fastest ever goal for the club, after just 18 seconds he drove the ball past Caersws's goalkeeper from the edge of the box.
This cementing him into Cwmbran's history books.
In March 2005 Richard left Cwmbran Town to pursue a football career in the US where he was awarded a four-year soccer scholarship at Savannah College of Art and Design.
While at college in the US he achieved All Region, All Conference and All American honors in his first 3 seasons and broke two college records in doing so.
On 12 March 2012 signed for Australian side Peninsula Power Football Club and played on 18 March his Debut against Capalaba Football Club in the Brisbane Premier League.
During his time at Cwmbran, Richard also picked up a succession of international caps for the Welsh U19's team after impressing manager Neville Southall in an international friendly against Norway he was chosen to play in the Milk Cup against Paraguay, Northern Ireland and Scotland and would also serve his country in the European U19 championship playing against Hungary, Andorra and Ireland.
Neville Southall once described Richard as being 'the first ever £1million unattached player' whilst on international duty.

The Seven Lamps of Architecture is an extended essay, first published in May 1849 and written by the English art critic and theorist John Ruskin.
The 'lamps' of the title are Ruskin's principles of architecture, which he later enlarged upon in the three-volume "The Stones of Venice".
To an extent, they codified some of the contemporary thinking behind the Gothic Revival.
At the time of its publication A. W. N. Pugin and others had already advanced the ideas of the Revival and it was well under way in practice.
Ruskin offered little new to the debate, but the book helped to capture and summarise the thoughts of the movement.
"The Seven Lamps" also proved a great popular success, and received the approval of the ecclesiologists typified by the Cambridge Camden Society, who criticised in their publication "The Ecclesiologist" lapses committed by modern architects in ecclesiastical commissions.
The essay was published in book form in May 1849 and is structured with eight chapters; an introduction and one chapter for each of the seven 'Lamps', which represent the demands that good architecture must meet, expressed as directions in which the association of ideas may take the observer:
Writing within the essentially British tradition of the associational values that inform aesthetic appreciation, Ruskin argued from a moral stance with polemic tone, that the technical innovations of architecture since the Renaissance and particularly the Industrial Revolution, had subsumed its spiritual content and sapped its vitality.
He also argued that no new style was needed to redress this problem, as the appropriate styles already existed.
The essay sketched out the principles which Ruskin later expounded upon in the three-volume "The Stones of Venice" published between 1851 and 1853.
Practically, he suggested an 'honest' architecture with no veneers, finishes, hidden support nor machined mouldings and that beauty must be derived from nature and crafted by man.
Ruskin drew upon Archibald Alison's "Essays on the Nature and Principles of Taste" (1790–1810) for some of his principles, such as the requirement of leisured poise as the best state for appreciating beauty, the thought that the natural countryside is more conducive to producing an artist than the city, that the glory of architecture lies in its age.
"The Seven Lamps" was reduced to the status of a "moral gloss on Alison" by George L. Hersey, in "High Victorian Gothic".
He had an abiding confidence in the natural, untutored instinct for rightness and beauty in the average person: "all men have sense of what is right in this matter, if they would only use and apply this sense; every man knows where and how beauty gives him pleasure, if he would only ask for it when he does so, and not allow it to be forced upon him when he does not want it."
This contrasts with the thread of modernism that holds that people must be "taught to appreciate" good design.
Another contrast with modernism is in the aesthetic of functionality: Ruskin saw no beauty in well-designed tools: beauty is out of place where there is not serene leisure, or "if you thrust it into the places of toil.
For Ruskin, Beauty was not an inherent characteristic but a thing that could be applied to an object or withheld from it.
By 1849, A. W. N. Pugin and others had already advanced the ideas of the Gothic Revival and its popularity was secured.
Ruskin offered little new to the debate, but the book helped to capture and summarise the thoughts of the movement, proved a great popular success, and received the approval of "The ecclesiologists", the influential newsletter of architectural criticism published by the Cambridge Camden Society.
Effects such as the polychromy of High Victorian Gothic architecture may be traced to him, in a genre of "Ruskinian Gothic" that was practised in Britain and colonies like New Zealand and Canada, and in Anglophile strata of the United States.
Ruskin had made his debut as a critic of architecture with "The Poetry of Architecture" (1839), an essay in the picturesque that he later rejected, "The Seven Lamps" were still tentative steps for Ruskin's architectural criticism and offered a moral creed for architects.
He later went on to disclaim the essay as a 'wretched rant'.
Politician Alexander Beresford Hope and architect Butterfield had agreed upon the general details just a month after Ruskin's book was published and by August they had revised their plans to encapsulate the principles it espoused.
All Saints is considered the first Ruskinian building due to its use of brick 'honestly' employed as a structural system rather than for surface decoration.
In the United States, Ralph Waldo Emerson's expectations of a new, authentic American style had prepared the ground: Ruskin's "Seven Lamps" were quickly assimilated into the aesthetics of Transcendentalism.
In 1899 Marcel Proust read a translation of Ruskin's chapter "The Lamp of Memory" in a Belgian magazine.
He projected the transforming experience onto the narrator of "Du côté de chez Swann", who describes himself as a boy reading the piece in the garden at Combray.
Later Proust, who translated some works of Ruskin, claimed to know "The Seven Lamps of Architecture" by heart.
"Seven Lamps of Architecture" and other of Ruskin's writings on architecture are summarized and extensively quoted in John Unrau, "Looking at Architecture with Ruskin" (Toronto: University of Toronto), 1978.
Writing in the preface to the first edition Ruskin remarks;
Having much more serious work in hand, and desiring merely to render them illustrative of my meaning, I have sometimes very completely failed even of that humble aim; and the text, being generally written before the illustration was completed, sometimes naively describes as sublime or beautiful features which the plates represents by a blot.
I shall be grateful if the reader will in such cases refer the expressions of praise to the Architecture, and not to the illustrations.
The following illustrations are from the third edition where the situation had been much improved.
Qatar–Russia relations  refers to bilateral foreign relations between the two countries, Qatar and Russia.
Following Saudi Arabia's lead, Qatar refused for many years to have diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.
This changed in the summer of 1988, when diplomatic relations between the two states were established on 2 August.
The Soviet Union opened its embassy in Doha on 12 November 1989, and Qatar opened its embassy in Moscow on 14 November 1989.
On 26 December 1991, Qatar recognised the Russian Federation as the successor state to the Soviet Union, after the latter's dissolution.
The current Ambassador of Russia to Qatar is Andrey Vladimirovich Andreyev, who was appointed by President Vladimir Putin on 17 July 2005.
The current Ambassador of Qatar to Russia is Ahmed Saif Al-Midhadi, who appointed his Letters of Credence to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on 27 February 2009.
Relations became strained after Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev was assassinated in Qatar on 13 February 2004.
On the third anniversary of Yandarbiyev's death, Russian President Vladimir Putin traveled to Qatar on a state visit, where he was received by Emir of Qatar Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani.
On November 29, 2011, Russian Ambassador to Qatar, Vladimir Titorenko, was allegedly assaulted by Qatar airport security and customs officers when he refused to have his suitcase scanned at the airport.
Relations again became strained on February 7, 2012, when reportedly, after a diplomat from Qatar warned Russia of losing the support of Arab League about upcoming resolution on the Syrian uprising, which Russia and China later vetoed, the answer came harsh from Russian ambassador Vitaly Churkin who replied that "If you talk to me like that, there will be no Qatar today" and boasted about Russian military superiority over Qatar.
Later, Russia denied all these accusations.
Russian and Qatar gas producers agree to develop oil refineries in Yamal Peninsula along with halal reindeer meat.
12 Feb 2007 in Doha in the framework of the official program of the visit to Qatar of the President of Russian Federation Vladimir Putin signed an Agreement to establish a Russian-Qatari Business Council.

High-level verification (HLV), or electronic system-level (ESL) verification, is the task to verify ESL designs at high abstraction level, i.e., it is the task to verify a model that represents hardware above register-transfer level (RTL) abstract level.
For high-level synthesis (HLS or C synthesis), HLV is to HLS as functional verification is to logic synthesis.
Electronic digital hardware design has evolved from low level abstraction at gate level to register transfer level (RTL), the abstraction level above RTL is commonly called high-level, ESL, or behavioral/algorithmic level.
In high-level synthesis, behavioral/algorithmic designs in ANSI C/C++/SystemC code is synthesized to RTL, which is then synthesized into gate level through logic synthesis.
Functional verification is the task to make sure a design at RTL or gate level conforms to a specification.
As logic synthesis matures, most functional verification is done at the higher abstraction, i.e. at RTL level, the correctness of logic synthesis tool in the translating process from RTL description to gate netlist is a less concern today.
High-level synthesis is still an emerging technology, so High-level verification today has two important areas under development
The tetraploid complementation assay is a technique in biology in which cells of two mammalian embryos are combined to form a new embryo.
It is used to construct genetically modified organisms, to study the consequences of certain mutations on embryonal development, and in the study of pluripotent stem cells.
Normal mammalian somatic cells are diploid: each chromosome (and thus every gene) is present in duplicate (excluding genes from X chromosome absent in Y chromosome).
The assay starts with producing a "tetraploid" cell in which every chromosome exists fourfold.
This is done by taking an embryo at the two-cell stage and fusing the two cells by applying an electrical current.
The resulting tetraploid cell will continue to divide, and all daughter cells will also be tetraploid.
Such a tetraploid embryo can develop normally to the blastocyst stage and will implant in the wall of the uterus.
The tetraploid cells can form the extra-embryonic tissue (placenta etc.), however a proper fetus will rarely develop.
In the tetraploid complementation assay, one now combines such a tetraploid embryo (either at the morula or blastocyst stage) with normal diploid embryonic stem cells (ES) from a different organism.
The embryo will then develop normally; the fetus is exclusively derived from the ES cell, while the extra-embryonic tissues are exclusively derived from the tetraploid cells.
A nitrilium ion is a nitrile that has been protonated, [RCNH], or alkylated, [RCNR′].
Nitriles are only weakly basic and are poor nucleophiles, but they will attack very reactive electrophiles such as carbocations.
Nitrilium salts can be prepared by reacting nitriles with trialkyloxonium salts.
The nitrilium ions thus formed can then be reduced to secondary amines with sodium borohydride in diglyme.
Nitrilium ions are believed to be intermediates in the hydrolysis of nitriles, the Beckmann rearrangement, the Friedel-Crafts cyclization of amines to isoquinolines, the Schmidt reaction with ketones, and the Ugi, Ritter, Pinner and Passerini reactions.
Information about the play can be found at http://www.burkecohenent.com/439032480.
The play had a workshop run in July 2009 at the "Dog Run Repertory Company," and a rewritten version had an Off-Broadway run in the Spring of 2012 Off Broadway at The Roundabout Theater's Harold and Mimi Steinberg Theatre Center.
That production was filmed and the film was broadcast nationally on PBS and can be viewed at digitaltheatre.com.
On May 2, 2016, "The Soap Myth" was presented as a reading at the Bruno Walter Auditorium at the Lincoln Center Library for the Performing Arts.
The reading, directed by Pam Berlin, starred legendary 7-time Emmy Award winning actor Ed Asner and 2-time Tony Award nominee Jayne Atkinson.
The cast also included Blair Baker and Donald Corren.
The reading, produced by Burke-Cohen Entertainment, was the flagship event of Remembrance Readings, a national program in honor of Holocaust Memorial Day presented by the National Jewish Theater Foundation.
From January 22 to February 1, 2018, "The Soap Myth" enjoyed a brief tour starring Ed Asner as Holocaust survivor Milton Saltzman and two time Tony Award nominee Johanna Day in the dual roles of Holocaust scholar Esther Feinman and Holocaust denier Brenda Goodsen.
Blair Baker again played Annie Blumberg and Ned Eisenberg played the roles that had previously been played by Donald Corren.
The play was again directed by Pam Berlin.
The largely sold-out performances were at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts in Miami Beach, FL, the Adolph and Rose Levis Jewish Community Center in Boca Raton, FL, the Parker Playhouse in Fort Lauderdale, FL, the Zeiterion Theater Performing Arts Center in New Bedford, MA, Congregation Rodeph Shalom in Philadelphia, PA, The Museum of Jewish Heritage in Battery Park City, New York City, and Hofstra University in Hempstead, Long Island, NY.
"The Soap Myth" dramatizes the powerful confrontation between survivor memory and historical memory and depicts the insidiousness of Holocaust denial.
More than a half century after World War II, at the desperate urging of a passionate survivor, a young investigative reporter finds herself caught between numerous versions of the same story and trying to separate fact from fiction.
Did the Nazis make soap from the corpses of their murdered Jewish victims?
Played out against the backdrop of deadline reporting and journalistic integrity, Jeff Cohen's critically acclaimed play The Soap Myth uses this horrific possibility as its catalyst.
It questions who deserves the right to write history — those who have lived it and remember, those studying and protecting it, or those seeking to distort its very existence?
And finally, what responsibility should others take once they know the truth?
Although "The Soap Myth" is a work of fiction, it is, in the words of the program, "inspired by real people and real events as well as an article written by Josh Rolnick in "Moment" magazine profiling Holocaust survivor Morris Spitzer."
Foremost among the play's historical inspirations is the evidence that the Nazi regime had a program at the Danzig Anatomic Institute in 1944 to develop a process for the mass-production of soap from the fat of Jews being slaughtered in Nazi extermination camps, and produced soap in small quantities at a nearby concentration camp.
In a dramatic moment, the players re-enact testimony from the Nuremberg Trials, including this recipe:
5 kilos of human fat are mixed with 10 liters of water and 500 or 1,000 grams of caustic soda.
The soap floats to the surface while the water and other sediment remain at the bottom.
A bit of salt and soda is added to this mixture.
Then fresh water is added and the mixture again boiled 2 or 3 hours.
After having cooled, the soap is poured into molds."
The play's central character, is an elderly Holocaust survivor called Milton Saltzman, worked doggedly to establish as fact the idea that the Nazis produced and used soap made from human corpses, even handing bars of such soap to Jews on their way into the sealed chambers that functioned alternately as gas chambers and as shower rooms in the Nazi concentration camps.
The second character is a young journalist called Annie Blumberg assigned to write a story about Saltzman.
She is soon caught between her sympathies for Saltzman and the adamant stand of a number of distinguished scholars of the Holocaust who refuse to publish the Nazi manufacture of soap as fact despite a large amount of eyewitness testimony, including the eyewitness testimony of both Nazis and British prisoners of war at the Nuremberg trial who worked in the experimental soap manufacturing facility at Danzig in 1944, because contemporary documentation is lacking.
Two characters representing historians of the Holocaust argue strongly that although a large number of eyewitnesses including former British POWs, Nazis, and Holocaust survivors have testified about the soap production, because no actual laboratory or production records survive as physical documents, any publication about the production of soap will be used by Holocaust deniers to discredit the reality of the Holocaust itself and, therefore, that no assertions that any soap production took place should be published.
A character called Brenda Goodsen, an amalgam of a number of Holocaust deniers including David Irving, appears in the play to demonstrate the evil of anti-Semitism in the form of Holocaust Denial.
This character delivers a speech for minimizing the Holocaust and concluding that the Jews brought it on themselves.
Holocaust historian Robert Melvin Spector concludes that the Nazis "did indeed use human fat for the making of soap at Stutthof," albeit in limited quantity.
The material in the Nuremberg Trial scenes in the play use as dialogue actual testimony given by British prisoners of war and by Nazis at the historical trials about the development of an industrial process for producing soap from human bodies at the Danzig Anatomic Institute, the production of such soap on a small-scale basis at Stutthof concentration camp, and the actual use of this soap by Nazi personnel.
A film, directed by Ron Kopp and Mr. Mittelman, was made of the National Jewish Theater production.
That film will be broadcast nationally through American Public Television on PBS stations across the country.
The sponsoring station, WPBT2 in Miami, will air the premiere broadcast on January 27, 2014.
Ron Kopp also directed "I Will Refuse to Bubble: History and Theater as Defiance," a documentary about the making of "The Soap Myth" that examines the question of who has the right to write history, highlighting the importance of theater in understanding the world's most incomprehensible events.
Featuring Holocaust survivor Irving Roth and scholars Michael Berenbaum, David Marwell and Bonnie Gurewitsch, it also is distributed online by Digital Theatre.
He is now known for his arguments against William Sherlock, who had justified the change of monarch of 1688-9 and his own switch of sides in "The Case of the Allegiance".
According to J. P. Kenyon, Kettlewell's reply made a case "with which conformist Anglicans could only agree, because it was spiritual, while Sherlock's was resolutely aspiritual".
He went on to attack defenders of the Glorious Revolution generally as proponents of fallacious contractarian theories.
He was the second son of John Kettlewell, a merchant at Northallerton, Yorkshire, by his wife, Elizabeth Ogle, was born 10 March 1653, and was educated at Northallerton Grammar School under Thomas Smelt, a royalist, whose other pupils included George Hickes, William Palliser, Thomas Burnet, Thomas Rymer, and John Radcliffe.
Kettlewell matriculated at St Edmund Hall, Oxford on 11 November 1670, and graduated B.A. 20 June 1674.
On Radcliffe's resignation of a fellowship at Lincoln College, Oxford, Kettlewell was elected in his place in July 1675, with the backing of George Hickes, then himself a Fellow.
For about five years he acted as tutor in college, and proceeded M.A. 3 May 1677.
He was ordained deacon by John Fell in Christ Church Cathedral 10 June 1677, and priest 24 February 1678.
The reputation which his first book made for him led to his appointment as chaplain to Anne, Countess of Bedford, and to his presentation by Simon Digby, 4th Baron Digby to the vicarage of Coleshill, Warwickshire (December 1682).
He resigned his fellowship at Lincoln College on 22 November 1683, devoted himself to his parish, where he preached the high church doctrine of passive obedience.
In 1685 Kettlewell married.
Through the Glorious Revolution he preached strongly against rebellion; he adhered consistently to this principle, and was deprived of his vicarage in 1690.
He moved to London, and spent the remainder of his life, occupied in the composition of devotional books and controversial tracts.
Shortly before his death he proposed to Bishop Thomas Ken the establishment of a fund for the relief of the suffering deprived clergy; and circulars asking for subscriptions were issued.
But the charitable scheme was regarded by the government as a seditious usurpation of authority, and prosecutions were instituted.
Kettlewell died at his house in Gray's Inn Lane on 12 April 1695, at the age of 42.
He was buried on 15 April in the church of All Hallows Barking, in the same grave in which William Laud had been interred, and was commemorated in a Latin inscription on a marble tablet erected by his widow at the east end of the church.
At Kettlewell's funeral Ken officiated for the only time in public after his deprivation.
Kettlewell had married at Whitchurch, near Reading, on 4 October 1685, Jane, daughter of Anthony Lybb of Hardwick House in the parish of Whitchurch; they had no children.
His papers were entrusted by his widow to Robert Nelson, who published some of them.
His first book, 'The Measures of Christian Obedience,' a summary of Christian morals as involved in obedience to the laws of the Gospel, was written between Christmas 1677 and Easter 1678, but was not published until 1681, when, at Hickes's suggestion, Kettlewell dedicated it to Henry Compton, bishop of London, but this dedication he suppressed after Compton had appeared in military array on behalf of the Prince of Orange.
His second publication resulted from his parochial work; he was in the habit of preaching preparation-sermons before communion, eight or nine times in the year, and of these he printed a summary in 1683 under the title of "An Help and Exhortation to Worthy Communicating", dedicating the book to Lord Digby.
Shortly after the suppression of Monmouth's rebellion he preached a sermon, in his collected works with the title of "Measures of Christian Subjection."
As a supplement to his first book, that on "Christian Obedience", he published in February 1687-8 his "Practical Believer", which passed through many editions.
A treatise on the new oaths was left by him in manuscript, but never printed.
Studio Miraval is a recording studio in Correns in southern France, situated in the heart of the department of Var near the French Riviera.
Many famous musicians have recorded there, including Rammstein, Sade, AC/DC, The Cure, and Shirley Bassey.
The recording studio itself measures with a ceiling.
The studio was created in 1977 by jazz pianist Jacques Loussier and sound engineer Patrice Quef.
Loussier began by recording his own work, mainly for films, and then started taking on French clients such as Maxime Le Forestier and Pierre Vassiliu.
Miraval achieved fame thanks to Pink Floyd, who came there in 1979 to record part of their album "The Wall", the liner notes of which credit Miraval.
Subsequently, equipped with one of the first SSL mixing consoles in France, Miraval recorded AC/DC, The Cure, Muse, Wham!
In 1992, Loussier sold Miraval to an American buyer.
The studio remained active, in particular for the recording of Jacques' trio's albums.
Since 2003, when Courtney Love spent several weeks there, the studio has throttled back, and it has suffered from the declining record sales plaguing the music industry in the 2000s.
Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have been renting Miraval since the summer of 2008, which probably hinders commercial exploitation of the recording studio.
His primary vehicle was the #18 self-owned Pontiac machine; although he would occasionally drive a Hudson vehicle on the race track.
He raced in the NASCAR Grand National Series from 1953 to 1956.
Like J.D. McDuffie, Alan Kulwicki, and Joe Nemechek, Mounts was an "independent" race car driver who would never receive manufacturer's support or the support of blockbuster sponsors.
Arden would earn six finishes in the top ten from the 37 races that he would compete in NASCAR.
The 1954 Grand National season would see Mounts record his best championship finish at 21st place in the standings.
During his career, Mounts would earn $2,505 in race winnings ($ when adjusted for inflation) and race 4489 laps - the equivalent of .
Only the 1953 and 1956 NASCAR Cup Series seasons would see him finish better than he started in the races.
Mounts would end up losing nearly one position on average from start to finish during his entire career.
His appearance at the 1955 Southern 500, where he would crash into Don Duckworth's stalled vehicle, would be captured on highlight films for generations.
While Bill Champion managed to avoid Duckworth by swerving past the vehicle rapidly, Arden Mounts managed to see the stalled vehicle too late and crashed into him in a very hard manner.
The proper usage of seat belts on the stock car automobiles would save the lives of both Mounts and Duckworth.
The types of racing tracks that best favored Arden was the dirt tracks where he finished an average of 18th place; intermediate tracks were very much a disadvantage to Mounts, where a finish of 42nd place was the career average for him.
Mounts would die while being a patient at St. Mary's Hospital, a medical center in Huntington, West Virginia.
In addition, the company supports the classical guitar and guitarists by presenting several annual New York guitar series at the Manhattan School of Music, the Queen Sofia Spanish Institute and other important venues, by commissioning hundreds of original solo and chamber music works and concertos from some of the foremost contemporary composers, by donating thousands of dollars for scholarships, special artist's projects and guitar festivals, and by publishing Guitar Review magazine.
In 1926-7, Albert Augustine (born Denmark 1900, died New York City, April, 1967) moved to the United States to pursue his career as a luthier.
In 1928, he married his wife, Rose.
During this period, he experimented with different types of strings without significant result.
It was to be almost 20 years before his collaboration with famed guitarist Andrés Segovia would result in the development of the nylon guitar string.
In the mid-1940s, Andrés Segovia mentioned the shortage of good guitar strings in the United States, particularly his favorite Pirastro catgut strings, to a number of foreign diplomats at a party, including General Lindeman of the British Embassy.
A month later, the General presented Segovia with some nylon strings which he had obtained via some members of the DuPont family.
Segovia found that although the strings produced a clear sound, they had a faint metallic timbre which he hoped could be eliminated.
Nylon strings were first tried on stage by Olga Coelho in New York in January, 1944.
In 1946, Segovia and Augustine were introduced by their mutual friend Vladimir Bobri, editor of "Guitar Review".
On the basis of Segovia's interest and Augustine's past experiments, they decided to pursue the development of nylon strings.
DuPont, skeptical of the idea, agreed to supply the nylon if Augustine would endeavor to develop and produce the actual strings.
After three years of development, Augustine demonstrated a nylon first string whose quality impressed guitarists, including Segovia, in addition to DuPont.
Eventually, however, after experimenting with various types of metal and smoothing and polishing techniques, Augustine was also able to produce high quality nylon wound strings.
Augustine suffered a heart attack in 1948, but survived.
He commissioned a guitar from Augustine in 1956 which was never finished.
Augustine died of his second heart attack in 1967.
Under Rose Augustine and following her death in 2003, the company continues to produce nylon strings and support the field of classical guitar.
South Africa national rugby union team players hold several international records.
Several players from the South Africa national rugby union team have joined the IRB and International Hall of Fame.
Matfield is the "most-capped lock for any nation" in rugby history, with all of his 120 appearances at that position.
The "most-capped back" is Percy Montgomery, whose 102 caps made him the country's leader until first being equalled by John Smit and later surpassed by Matfield, but was regained by Smit.
Montgomery also holds the South African record for "Test points" with 893, which at the time of his international retirement placed him sixth on the all-time list of Test point scorers (he now stands ninth).
Steyn also holds the Springbok record for the "fastest 100 points" (8 Test matches)
Although statistics on the success rate of kicks at goal were not kept until the late 1980s, it is believed that Steyn also holds the record for "most consecutive successful kicks at goal in Tests".
He had a streak of 41 successful kicks at goal, which started during the Boks' Test against Italy on 19 June 2010 and ended on 6 November 2010 against Ireland.
John Smit was the "world's most-capped captain", having has captained South Africa in 82 of his 110 Tests.
He has since been overtaken by Richie McCaw and Brian O'Driscoll.
The "world's most-capped lock pairing" is that of Victor Matfield and Bakkies Botha, who have started together in 62 Tests.
Smit also played 46 "consecutive matches" for South Africa, which is a record.
The record "try scorer" is Bryan Habana with 67 international tries.
Fly-half Jannie de Beer holds the "world record for dropped goals in a Test match" (5, during the 44–21 quarter-final win over England in the 1999 Rugby World Cup)
The "most points" Montgomery ever scored in a "single international" was 35 against Namibia in 2007—this is also a South African record.
On 1 August during the 2009 Tri Nations tournament, Morné Steyn set a number of records during the second Test between the Springboks and the All Blacks.
The Springboks won 31–19, with Steyn scoring all South Africa's points – 1 try, 1 conversion, 8 penalties.
Eleven former South African international players have been inducted into either the International Rugby Hall of Fame or the IRB Hall of Fame.
Barry "Fairy" Heatlie, who played in the late 19th century and into the early 20th, was one of the early greats of South African rugby.
He appeared for Western Province 34 times between 1890 and 1904, with 28 of them being Currie Cup wins.
He also played six Tests for South Africa against the Lions in 1891, 1896, and 1903, and also captained the side to their only two Test wins of the 1890s.
Arguably his greatest legacy to South African rugby is the green jersey; he is credited with introducing the colour for South Africa's 1903 Test against the Lions at Newlands.
He was inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame in 2009.
Bennie Osler played 17 consecutive Tests between 1924 and 1933.
Playing at fly-half, his first Test was against the touring British team in 1924.
He also played in the series against the All Blacks in 1928, but most notably captained the Springboks on their Grand Slam tour of 1931–32 when they defeated all four Home Nations.
His last Tests were the five played against Australia when they toured to South Africa in 1933.
Osler was inducted to the International Rugby Hall of Fame in 2007 and the IRB Hall of Fame in 2009.
Making his Test debut in Olser's Grand Slam winning team in 1931 was scrum-half Danie Craven.
Craven played several positions including fly-half, scrum-half, centre and even number-eight.
However Craven was most famous for popularising the dive pass.
As well as winning a Grand Slam with Osler's team, Craven toured with 1937 Springboks to New Zealand where they achieved their first series victory over New Zealand.
His last act as player was captaining South Africa in a Test series against the Lions.
Craven's involvement with the Springboks continued after his playing retirement, and he coached them to a 4–0 series win over the touring All Blacks in 1949.
He was elected President of the South African Rugby Board in 1956, a position he held until the post-apartheid South African Rugby Union was formed in 1991.
Such was Craven's influence in South African rugby he became known as "Mr Rugby", was inducted into the International Hall of Fame in 1997, and was in the second class of inductees into the IRB Hall of Fame in 2007; behind Rugby School and William Webb Ellis.
The man most credited with inventing modern number 8 play was Hennie Muller, inducted into the International Hall of Fame in 2001.
He played 13 Tests between 1949 and 1953, and in the process won a 4–0 series victory over the All Blacks and a Grand Slam tour of Britain and Ireland.
He was nicknamed "Windhond" (greyhound) for his speed around the field.
When writing about the 1949 series against the All Blacks, Harding and Williams wrote: "(Okey) Geffin won the series, perhaps, but Muller made it possible."
Of Muller's 13 Tests, he only lost one—against Australia in 1953.
Named South Africa's player of the 20th Century in 2000, Frik du Preez played 38 Tests between 1961 and 1971.
Du Preez could play both flanker or lock and was one of the most dominant forwards of the 1960s, but was especially well known for his all round skills.
Danie Craven said of du Preez, "To my mind he could have played any position on a rugby field with equal brilliance."
He was inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame in 1997 and the IRB Hall of Fame in 2009.
Morne du Plessis played 22 Tests for South Africa between 1971 and 1980.
He went on to captain South Africa and became part of the only father-son pair to captain South Africa—his father had captained South Africa in 1949.
He led South Africa to a 3–1 series win over the All Blacks in 1976 and a series win over the British and Irish Lions in 1980 by the same margin.
Du Plessis would be inducted into the International Hall of Fame in 1999.
International Hall of Fame inductees Naas Botha, inducted in 2005, and Danie Gerber, inducted in 2007, both had careers interrupted by South Africa's sporting isolation in the 1980s and early 1990s.
Playing at fly-half, Botha played 28 Tests and scored 312 Test points before his international retirement in 1992.
Botha contributed significantly to the Springboks 1980 series win over the Lions, and also played for the World XV in the IRB Centenary Match at Twickenham.
Gerber also made his debut in 1980, and scored 19 tries in his 24 Tests before retiring in 1992.
He scored a hat-trick against England in 1984, and played alongside Botha in the World XV team in 1986.
In South Africa's first Test since the fall of apartheid, against the All Blacks in 1992, he scored twice.
Two players that straddled the amateur and professional eras were Francois Pienaar and Joost van der Westhuizen.
Both first played for the Springboks in 1993.
Pienaar was named captain in his first Test against France, and went on to captain the side to the 1995 World Cup.
It was there he captained South Africa to the World Cup title, and received the trophy from Nelson Mandela who was wearing his number 6 jersey.
Nelson Mandela later wrote "It was under Francois Pienaar's inspiring leadership that rugby became the pride of the entire country.
Francois brought the nation together."
Pienaar entered the International Hall of Fame in 2005, and was inducted into the IRB Hall in 2011 alongside all other World Cup-winning captains from the inaugural event in 1987 through 2007 (minus the previously inducted Australian John Eales).
Joost van der Westhuizen also participated in the 1995 World cup victory, but went on to play in two more World Cups.
Playing at scrum-half, van der Westhuizen played 89 Tests for South Africa and scored 38 tries.
At the time of his retirement following the 2003 World Cup he was South Africa's leading try scorer and most capped player.
He entered the International Hall of Fame two years after Pienaar, in 2007.
The newest Springbok player to enter the IRB Hall is John Smit, inducted in 2011 alongside Pienaar.
The captain of the 2007 World Cup winners, Smit (as noted earlier) ended his international career as the most-capped Springbok in history.
The 2009 Silver Helmet (BK) is the 2009 version of Bronze Helmet organized by the Polish Motor Union (PZM).
The Final took place on 11 September in Wrocław and was won by Maciej Janowski (Atlas Wrocław).
Janowski beat Patryk Dudek (Falubaz Zielona Góra) and Łukasz Sówka (KM Lazur Ostrów Wlkp.)
Gonville & Caius College (often referred to simply as Caius ) is a constituent college of the University of Cambridge in Cambridge, England.
The college has been attended by many students who have gone on to significant accomplishment, including fourteen Nobel Prize winners, the second-most of any Oxbridge college (after Trinity College, Cambridge).
The college has long historical associations with medical teaching, especially due to its alumni physicians: John Caius (who gave the college the caduceus in its insignia) and William Harvey.
Other famous alumni in the sciences include Francis Crick (joint discoverer, along with James Watson, of the structure of DNA), James Chadwick (discoverer of the neutron) and Howard Florey (developer of penicillin).
The college also maintains reputable academic programmes in many other disciplines, including law, economics, English literature and history.
Gonville & Caius is said to own or have rights to much of the land in Cambridge.
Several streets in the city, such as Harvey Road, Glisson Road and Gresham Road, are named after alumni of the College.
The college and its masters have been influential in the development of the university, founding other colleges like Trinity Hall and Darwin College and providing land on the Sidgwick Site, e.g. for the Squire Law Library.
The college was first founded, as "Gonville Hall", by Edmund Gonville, Rector of Terrington St Clement in Norfolk in 1348, making it the fourth-oldest surviving college.
When Gonville died three years later, he left a struggling institution with almost no money.
The executor of his will, William Bateman, Bishop of Norwich, stepped in, transferring the college to its current location.
He leased himself the land close to the river to set up his own college, Trinity Hall, and renamed Gonville Hall "The Hall of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary".
Bateman appointed as the first Master of the new college his former chaplain John Colton, later Archbishop of Armagh.
By the sixteenth century, the college had fallen into disrepair, and in 1557 it was refounded by Royal Charter as "Gonville & Caius College" by the physician John Caius.
He provided the college with significant funds and greatly extended the buildings.
During his time as Master, Caius accepted no payment but insisted on several unusual rules.
He insisted that the college admit no scholar who “is deformed, dumb, blind, lame, maimed, mutilated, a Welshman, or suffering from any grave or contagious illness, or an invalid, that is sick in a serious measure”.
Caius also built a three-sided court, Caius Court, “lest the air from being confined within a narrow space should become foul”.
Caius did, however, found the college as a strong centre for the study of medicine, a tradition that it aims to keep to this day.
By 1630, the college had expanded greatly, having around 25 fellows and 150 students, but numbers fell over the next century, only returning to the 1630 level in the early nineteenth century.
Since then the college has grown considerably and now has one of the largest undergraduate populations in the university.
The college first admitted women as fellows and students in 1979.
The first buildings to be erected on the college’s current site date from 1353 when Bateman built Gonville Court.
The college chapel was added in 1393 with the Old Hall (used until recently as a library) and Master’s Lodge following in the next half century.
Most of the stone used to build the college came from Ramsey Abbey near Ramsey, Cambridgeshire.
Gonville and Caius has the oldest purpose-built college chapel in either Oxford or Cambridge which has been in continuous use as such.
The chapel is situated centrally within the college, reflecting the college's religious foundation.
On the re-foundation by Caius, the college was expanded and updated.
In 1565 the building of Caius Court began, and Caius planted an avenue of trees in what is now known as Tree Court.
He was also responsible for the building of the college's three gates, symbolising the path of academic life.
On matriculation, one arrives at the Gate of Humility (near the Porters' Lodge).
In the centre of the college one passes through the Gate of Virtue regularly.
And finally, graduating students pass through the Gate of Honour on their way to the neighbouring Senate House to receive their degrees.
The students of Gonville and Caius commonly refer to the fourth gate in the college, between Tree Court and Gonville Court, which also gives access to some lavatories, as the Gate of Necessity.
The buildings of Gonville Court were given classical facades in the 1750s, and the Old Library and the Hall were designed by Anthony Salvin in 1854.
On the wall of the Hall hangs a college flag which in 1912 was flown at the South Pole by Cambridge's Edward Adrian Wilson during the famous Terra Nova Expedition of 1910–1913.
Gonville Court, though remodelled in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, is the oldest part of the college.
New lecture rooms were designed by Alfred Waterhouse and completed by Rattee and Kett in 1884.
It is so named because John Caius planted an avenue of trees there.
Although none of the original trees survive, the court retains a number of trees and the tree-lined avenue, which is unusual for a Cambridge front court.
Caius owns a substantial amount of land between West Road and Sidgwick Avenue.
Set in landscaped gardens, the modern Harvey Court (named after William Harvey and designed by Leslie Martin) was built on the West Road site in 1961.
Adjacent to Harvey Court is the Stephen Hawking Building, which opened its doors to first-year undergraduates in October 2006.
Providing ensuite accommodation for 75 students and eight fellows, as well as providing conference facilities in the vacations, the Stephen Hawking Building boasts some of the highest-standard student accommodation in Cambridge.
Additional buildings provide housing for older students, a day care, and various study and music rooms.
The college also owns extensive gardens and the land on which the adjacent Squire Law Library has stood since 1995.
Caius also has one of the largest libraries in Oxbridge, housed in the Cockerell Building.
Caius acquired the lease on the building, which previously housed the Seeley History Library and the Squire Law Library, in the 1990s.
The college library was relocated there from Gonville Court in the summer of 1996, following an extensive renovation.
These courts are across Trinity Street on land surrounding St Michael's Church.
St Michael's Court was completed only in the 1930s, with the building on its south side of a new building overlooking the Market Place.
The college also owns several houses around Cambridge, on Mortimer Road and Gresham Road, where some second year undergraduates live, and on Harvey Road and St Paul's Road, which are occupied by graduate students.
The Fellows' garden lies just beyond Harvey Court, on Sidgwick Avenue.
The extensive sports fields are located on Barton Road, a few minute's walk from Harvey Court.
Caius Boat Club is the college's boat club, with the men's 1st VIII remaining unbeaten in the seasons of 2010/11 and of 2011/2012.
Caius Jazz takes place most terms in the college bar, inviting 'some of the most illustrious names in the contemporary scene' and a house band of students studying at London conservatoires to play in the college bar.
In recent years Steve Fishwick, Sam Mayne, Ian Shaw, Barry Green, Gareth Lockrane, and Paul Jarvis have all been featured.
The Caius May Ball is an all-night party in June, held every two years.
The choir was founded by the composer Charles Wood in the late nineteenth century, and is currently directed by the scholar of South-American choral music, Geoffrey Webber.
The choir tours abroad and records eclectically.
"You All Dat " is a song recorded by the Bahamian group, Baha Men.
It featured guest vocals from American vocalist Imani Coppola.
Originally on 2 Zero 0-0, It was released in January 2001 as the second and final single from their album, "Who Let the Dogs Out".
It reached the top 10 in Australia and reached the top 20 in the United Kingdom.
The song, which samples "The Lion Sleeps Tonight", is about a man trying to seduce a woman at a party.
A "clean" edit changes the line "You gotta have balls or you ain't gonna get none" to "You gotta be bold or you ain't gonna get none."
The song was featured in season 2, episode 15 ("The Grandparents") of "Malcolm in the Middle".
It was also included on the show's soundtrack, "Music from Malcolm in the Middle", released in 2000.
The Oracle of the Lamb is an ancient Egyptian prophetic text written on a papyrus in Demotic Egyptian and dated to the thirty-third year of the reign of the Roman Emperor Augustus (r. 27 BC – 14 AD).
In it, a lamb speaks and provides prophecies to a man named Pasenhor.
The lamb describes a world turned upside-down and reduced to chaos: temples are in disarray, the ruler has now become the ruled, and the Medes (i.e. referring to the Persian domination of Egypt) have come to destroy Egypt.
It also mentions that the Greeks (i.e. referring to the Ptolemaic domination of Egypt) will take the White Crown (representing pharaonic Upper Egypt).

Diop Kamau (born Don Jackson, March 16, 1958) is an American civil rights activist who investigates and works to resolve instances of police misconduct, neglect, or abuse.
In 1994 he founded policeabuse.com, and is also its CEO.
Don Jackson is an African American civil rights activist and investigative journalist who has pioneered groundbreaking investigations into two of the nation's most pernicious dimensions of policing: bias-based profiling and the widespread refusal by the police to properly document serious allegations of abuse and egregious misconduct.
Jackson was born on March 16, 1958, at BonAir hospital in South Central Los Angeles.
He is the fourth child of Margie Faye Woods, a nurse, and Woodrow Jackson, one of the first African Americans to join the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Office.
Woodrow and Margie raised Don along with his five siblings in a neighborhood of manicured lawns and middle-class homes in Compton, California.
Don remembers his father rushing out of their home in the midst of the Watts rebllion in 1965 to join other police officers attempting to control the violence.
Jackson grew up in an environment where hard work was rewarded, and education was encouraged.
He attended Birmingham high school where he excelled in sports, serving as captain of both his high school football and wrestling team.
He went on to California Lutheran College on an athletic scholarship, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice.
After college Jackson joined the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office.
His time there was punctuated by tests of his character and physical stamina.
Despite the Ventura County police academy’s record of washing out black recruits, Jackson graduated from the academy and later transferred to the Hawthorne Police Department where he would hone his skills as an elite undercover investigator.
Jackson rose through the ranks quickly at Hawthorne as he sponsored several daring undercover operations.
Jackson was taught by his parents that when you are African American you must often be twice as good as your competitors.
With that in mind, he earned the top score on three consecutive promotional exams to become the youngest sergeant on the force.
But as his career flourished, Jackson became frustrated with the routine brutality and frequent racism displayed amongst his peers.
Jackson rebelled against his brothers in blue, first by filing complaints about misconduct directed against minority citizens, and later by going public with a complaint of racism at the Hawthorne Police Department.
As Jackson’s battle with the Hawthorne PD spilled into the media, his father Woodrow Jackson, who was near retirement, was stopped by a group of Pomona California police officers.
The officers identified the elder Jackson as a potential robbery suspect.
He was taken from his car and brutally attacked.
A midnight phone call between Jackson and his dad would change the course of Jackson’s life: After learning of the brutality his father suffered, Don decided to take on the police in a one-man war against abusive cops.
He used cutting edge computer technology to document police misconduct in 5000 investigations in over 100 cities, often accompanied by a rotating list of volunteers and undercover investigators willing to put their lives on the line to test the police.
News organizations became aware of Jackson’s efforts and often went in-tow.
Jackson’s most well-known such investigation was the 1989 test of the Long Beach, California Police Department.
While testing profiling among officers for a news broadcast, Jackson was beaten, thrown into a plate glass window, and arrested.
As is often the case in hundreds of similar incidents, the officers falsified their arrest report.
However, unlike the many hundreds of police-citizen interactions which are not filmed, this one was captured on video.
The video recording of Jackson’s arrest exploded on national television and resonated in a way that other stories about police misconduct failed to.
The videotaped arrest and the obviously false police report of the incident gave police critics a formidable weapon.
Congresswoman Maxine Waters, along with others, rallied to Jackson’s support and called for hearings and investigations.
In 1992, the California State Assembly held hearings and Jackson was called to testify.
The hearings resulted in a new law, which increased penalties for false reports to a felony and added requirements for all officers in the state of California to receive racial sensitivity training.
Though a new law had been passed, Jackson was not satisfied.
Jackson’s one-man war on the cops would change in 1991 when he met the love of his life, actress Tyra Ferrell, at a Hollywood party.
Ferrell was hanging out with friends at a house party when she and Jackson shared a glance.
It was love at first sight and the two would become inseparable a year later when they married.
The marriage ceremony was consecrated on the deathbed of Jackson’s mother Margie who was in the final stages of breast cancer.
Her final joy was watching her son take his vows of marriage with a woman she adored.
If anyone thought the marriage would slow down Jackson’s work, it had just the opposite effect.
Ferrell, an A-list African American actress who had just completed the trailblazing film Boyz in the Hood, joined Jackson to support his cause.
They left Southern California together in 1992, driving and camping out on a Goldwing motorcycle for their honeymoon.
With Ferrell’s support, Jackson purchased the most sophisticated recording equipment available and went on a tear across the country producing eight Emmy and Edward R Morrow award-winning investigations into police misconduct and racial profiling.
The investigations forced policy changes, police firings, and thousands of hours of retraining for officers stemming from the high-profile exposes Jackson produced with local and national media.
Jackson traveled the country with his wife, daughter, and a 40-foot RV hauled by a Ford F350 pick-up truck loaded with hi-tech investigative equipment.
As Jackson hit the streets, Tyra Ferrell stood by his side guiding his investigations.
Many times, Ferrell was up all-night waiting by the phone to make sure Jackson got home safe.
In 1994, Jackson and Ferrell started Policeabuse.com to provide a safe place for citizens to report complaints.
Over 25 years, the website has processed more than 20,000 complaints for citizens free of charge.
Through the website Ferrell and Jackson have pioneered hundreds of investigations resulting in prosecutions of police officers, policy changes, and settlements for indigent victims.
Today their work stands alone as the only national hidden camera testing of police complaint intake procedures and racial profiling ever done.
Their work is a 600 video YouTube archive of investigations on behalf of police misconduct victims.Many police agencies have made policy changes as a direct result of Jackson’s hidden camera investigations.
Jackson and Ferrell’s videotapes and training materials have been utilized to educate both officers and citizens alike.
In 1994, as a political statement, Jackson changed his name to Diop Kamau (Quiet Soldier) to acknowledge his daughter’s birth.
24 years later Jackson returned to his birth name Don Jackson, as a tribute to his father Woodrow Jackson, the best cop he had ever known .
He was born in Los Angeles, California.
Beyond Reach is the sixth novel in the Grant County series by Karin Slaughter, originally published in 2007 .
The previous books in the series are "Blindsighted, Kisscut, A Faint Cold Fear, Indelible", and "Faithless".
"Beyond Reach" was released in European market with the title Skin Privilege.
The books feature characters Sara Linton, Jeffrey Tolliver, and Lena Adams.
In this book, a main character of the series is impacted in a serious way, which resulted in much controversy and commentary on the event -- including spoilers being posted in online book review venues.
Slaughter has written a note to her readers about her decision, which is posted on her website.
The Heartsdale Children's Clinic is closed.
Sara spends all day being deposed in a malpractice lawsuit filed by the parents of Jimmy Powell, now dead from leukemia, and a deep-pockets-picking lawyer, over a ridiculous technicality.
Everything she's built up for the last 16 years is crumbling away as greedy townspeople line up to get in on the action, not realizing their betrayal of her is only going to result in higher healthcare costs for everyone or that the nearest pediatrician is 100 miles away.
Sara's parents are gone on a cross-country RV trip and her sister is counseling the homeless in Atlanta, only old/new husband Jeffrey is there for support.
When he's called away to the town of Reese, it's almost a relief to get to go with him...except that they're going because Lena lies in a hospital with smoke inhalation, under arrest and suspected of being involved in murder.
She was found beaten badly, watching a torched SUV burn with a body inside it, on the 50-yard line of the high school football field, foot propped on an empty gas can.
And she won't say a word to anyone.
Reese is Lena's home town, and she came back to check on her Uncle Hank, the ex-addict who raised her and her twin sister.
She found him mixed up with some very unsavory characters and hooked on drugs again after being clean for three decades.
And major events from her past are now in question, events that shaped who she is.
One of the few things of which she is certain is that Jeffrey and Sara are in terrible danger, and she must stop at nothing to get them out of town.

Birra Korça is a brewing company, founded in Korçë, Albania, in 1928.
Birra Korça is the first beer brewed in Albania.
The brewery was established in the town of Korçë, Albania, in 1928.
It was founded by an Italian investor Umberto Umberti and Selim Mboria a local investor.
It produced Blonde Ale Beer, Dark ale, bottled water “Kristal” and ice.
After the end of World War II and with the establishment of the communist regime in Albania on January 11, 1946, the brewery became property of the Albanian State, according to the laws of the time.
Several reconstructions and renovations were done in the years 1955, 1957 and 1965 and the production was gradually increased.
In April 1994 following the change in the political climate, as well as economic downturn, political and social unrest, followed by the liberalization of the market, in Albania the brewery was sold in auction and was bought by a group of businessmen.
In 2004 the brewery was bought by the businessman Irfan Hysenbelliu the president of “Birra Korça LLC”.
Soon after this a 15 million euro (€) investment was made to renovate and renew the factory.
Since then the brewery has undergone a deep technological and architectural reconstruction.
The traditional design has been preserved by adding new elements of the same style.
Using the latest Czech and Italian technology it brews 120,000 hectoliters of beer annually, ten times the output of the old brewery.
The water comes from natural springs of Morava Mountain.
Birra Korca holds an annual beerfest during the month of August which is the biggest in the region.
Beers under the Korça brand include: Blonde Ale, European type pilsner 4.8-5% abv and Dark Ale a 5-5.2% abv Euro dark lager (dunkel).

The 1987 Rugby World Cup Final was the final match in the 1987 Rugby World Cup, the first Rugby World Cup played.
It was played at Eden Park in Auckland, New Zealand on 20 June 1987 between the hosts New Zealand and France.
New Zealand won the match 29–9 with three tries, one conversion, four penalties and a drop goal, becoming the first winners of the Rugby World Cup.
In front of a capacity crowd at Eden Park, hosts New Zealand met France in the inaugural Rugby World Cup Final .
France seemed lacklustre following their amazing win over Australia in the semi-final .
New Zealand played a mainly kicking game in the first half with Grant Fox kicking for territory and position .
A Fox drop goal after 14 minutes settled home nerves .
A try by the World Cup's star performer Michael Jones, followed just 3 minutes later .
Jones' try was converted by Fox, a tense final was finely balanced at half time with New Zealand leading France 9–0 .
France came out with renewed vigour after the break and a Didier Camberabero penalty four minutes into the half put France on the scoreboard .
Tries by David Kirk and John Kirwan together with the relentlessly accurate goal kicking of Fox meant that going into the final moments New Zealand led 29–3 .
A final surge near the whistle led to a France try through Pierre Berbizier .
The try was converted as the last kick of the game by Didier Camberabero .
The final had hardly lived up to its billing, probably due to the exertions by France in their semi-final win.
It was however fitting that tries from three stars of the tournament Jones, Kirk and Kirwan won the contest and gave New Zealand the Webb Ellis Cup.

In December 2014, former deputy marshal Brian Pope was elected to the office of city marshal, succeeding long-time incumbent Earl "Nickey" Picard, who had held the position of Lafayette city marshal since 1984.
In October 2018, Brian Pope was later convicted of several felony charges and removed from office.
Former Marshal Pope still faces 7 additional felony charges with more charges pending.
He retired in 1988 to become Emeritus Professor at the University of York, where he continued to research.

Venables published over 260 journal articles, book chapters, and books.
Three of his articles have been recognized as citation classics.
His contributions in the fields of schizophrenia and psychophysiology embraced a wide range of topics that included clinical, cognitive, neuroanatomical, psychophysiological, and neurodevelopmental issues.
Kosmos 268 (meaning "Cosmos 268"), known before launch as DS-P1-Yu No.18, was a Soviet satellite which was used as a radar calibration target for tests of anti-ballistic missiles.
It was a spacecraft, which was built by the Yuzhnoye Design Bureau, and launched in 1969 as part of the Dnepropetrovsk Sputnik programme.
Kosmos 268 was launched from Site 86/4 at Kapustin Yar, atop a Kosmos-2I 63SM carrier rocket.
The launch occurred on 5 March 1969 at 13:04:55 UTC, and resulted in Kosmos 268's successful deployment into low Earth orbit.
Upon reaching orbit, it was assigned its Kosmos designation, and received the International Designator 1969-020A.
Kosmos 268 was operated in an orbit with a perigee of , an apogee of , 48.4 degrees of inclination, and an orbital period of 108 minutes.
It remained in orbit until it decayed and reentered the atmosphere on 9 May 1970.
It was the nineteenth of seventy nine DS-P1-Yu satellites to be launched, and the eighteenth of seventy two to successfully reach orbit.
The stadium holds 3,206 spectators.
The 1960 Daytona 500 was a NASCAR Grand National Series (now Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series) stock car race that was held on February 14, 1960, at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida, United States.
The race featured 200 laps on the asphalt tri-oval, and was won by Junior Johnson.
Gasoline from the Pure Oil brand was offered to each qualifying driver free of charge prior to the race.
Even during these times, the fuel sponsor was stressing the importance of safety around flammable liquids by not allowing drivers to smoke while their vehicles were being refueled.
Elmo Langley's vehicle was notable seen around the race track at all times; with its mechanical work fine-tuned by owner/mechanic Ratus Walters.
The race was won by Junior Johnson driving a 1959 Chevrolet owned by John Masoni.
Johnson drove the number 27 to victory in just over four hours after starting in the 9th position.
Bud Burdick, Pappy Crane, Dick Foley, Dick Freeman, Tommy Herbert, Dave Hirschfield, Bob Kosiski, Shep Langdon and Bill Lutz would retire from NASCAR after this event.
In late January 1960 the CBS network sent anchorman Bud Palmer and other employees to Daytona to cover the events in the first ever televised coverage of a NASCAR event.
Johnson took the lead with nine laps remaining when Bobby Johns spun, and Johnson went on to win the race.
It was also known as being the slowest Daytona 500 race in history.
In the largest crash in racing history, 37 cars crashed in Turn 4; the worst injuries sustained were minor cuts and bruises.
Race winner Junior Johnson went on to achieve multiple accolades in the following years; including being inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1990 and being selected as one of NASCAR's 50 Top drivers in 1998.
On February 4, 2010 NASCAR announced that Johnson would be Grand Marshal for the 50th anniversary of his 1960 victory.
Part of Johnson's duties as Grand Marshal would be to utter the immortal words "Gentleman, start your engines" at the 52nd running of the Daytona 500 on February 14, 2010.
The race lasted 4:00:30, with an average speed of 124.74 mph.
The following is a list of characters who have appeared on the USA Network series "Royal Pains".
Dr. Henry "Hank" Lawson (Mark Feuerstein): A successful New York ER doctor soon to be married to his lovely fiancée, he was dismissed from his job because he triaged a dying teenager before a billionaire hospital benefactor.
The benefactor dies, after being initially stabilized following a femoral artery catheterization, from causes attributed to pericardial tamponade.
Hank stands up for himself by stating he saved the kid.
He spends the next month in a tailspin of broken engagements and unpaid bills before his brother convinces him to attend a posh party in the Hamptons.
At the party, he saves supermodel April, and wins the favor of the German nobleman, Boris.
This leads to referrals to other rich clientele.
Despite Hank's dislike of the upper class, a potential love interest in local hospital administrator Jill Casey convinces him to become a concierge doctor.
He drives a well-aged Saab 900 Turbo convertible.
He is originally from New Jersey and sometimes throws a Jerseyism into his speech.
In the episode "Keeping the Faith", he mentions that he is Jewish.
In the episode "Business and Pleasure", Hank mentions that he graduated from Northwestern University and Mount Sinai School of Medicine.
In the third season finale, Hank and Evan have split, with Hank leaving HankMed and Evan hiring Dr. Van Dyke to replace him.
Hank rejoins HankMed in the middle of the fourth season.
In the fourth season finale, Hank has a major accident and knocks his head, needing surgery.
In the fifth season, Hank is still recovering from his surgery and becomes dependent on pain medication that he gets Jeremiah to prescribe.
In the season finale, Hank takes Boris' job offer to travel with him and his family and be their personal doctor.
In the series finale, Hank again receives an offer by Boris to travel with him and his family and be their personal doctor.
Hank declines, choosing instead to travel to Africa and re-unite with Jill.
Three years later, during the Memorial Day holiday, he and Jill, now married, return to the Hamptons to be with Evan, Paige and their family and continue with HankMed.
He is an accountant (CPA), makes himself Hank's CFO after he establishes "HankMed" as well as the unofficial Public Relations Manager.
He views the Hamptons as a place to pursue attractive women, especially Divya, who continually rebuffs him.
He is materialistic, especially in comparison to Hank and when promised money and fun, he is up to do anything.
He tries to promote HankMed against Hank's will, and many of his subplots revolve around him engaging in some scheme (against Hank's wishes) that ends up going wrong.
When Hank is given a Tesla all-electric roadster by "New Parts" Newberg and her dog Koufax, Hank in turn gives it to Evan (who later, to help out HankMed's struggling finances, sells it).
While many of his intentions (if not his motives) are good, he originally doesn't seem to realize the consequences of some of his actions; for example, in episode 12, "Wonderland", Evan invests all the capital from HankMed into a con stock company investment with a broker who turns out to be his and Hank's father.
When this goes disastrously wrong, he leaves the Hamptons, informing his brother that he is going to try to get the money back.
Evan is a womanizer (unsuccessfully most of the time), but it is often hinted that he is attracted to Divya, as he continues to make passes at her despite her rather harsh rebuffs.
She kisses him passionately in episode 10, "Am I Blue?"
, to keep him from getting beaten up by the angry boyfriend of a girl Evan had been trying to be "just friends" with.
Evan also has a soft/blind spot where his father Eddie is concerned.
When Eddie reappears in the brothers' lives, Evan, unlike Hank, wants to forgive and forget, for a long time refusing to see character flaws in Eddie which Hank and Boris have immediately spotted, which makes Boris' exposure of Eddie's criminal acts towards the end of Season 2 even worse.
However, Evan is still determined to maintain a relationship with Eddie, and the brothers stand by their father when he is sentenced.
In Season 8 after Eddie disappears without a word on the day of his marriage to Ms. Newberg, Evan is determined to finally break off any relationship with his father, and it is only through Hank's efforts that they are reconciled.
By the second season finale, he is finally in a serious relationship with Paige Collins and at Hank's urging has left with her for a trip to Europe.
In the third season, he proposes to Paige and they are engaged, but his ambitions and plans to expand HankMed cause major friction between himself and Hank.
They get married with Eddie as the minister (his license from the internet) which turns out, in season 5, to not be legal in the Hamptons township bylaws.
In the sixth season, Hank offers them his spare room, but Paige and Evan rent a new home and insist that Emma stay with them.
This causes tension, as they begin to feel very cramped in such a small space with three people.
Their landlord helps them realize mid-squabble that Paige and Evan tend to put others needs above their own and they "do this to ourselves."
In Season 7, Boris buys Hampton Heritage and appoints Evan as Interim Hospital Administrator.
In the series finale, when Boris leaves the Hamptons permanently, he gives Evan full tenancy of Shadow Pond.
He later has her formal title changed to Physician Associate, on the grounds that people only look at the "Assistant" part of the title.
She interviews to be Hank's physician assistant after word travels of Hank's instant reputation as a concierge doctor.
Initially brushed off by Hank (despite her truckload of medical equipment), she has gained the job by the second episode.
She is Indian and her family spends the summer in the Hamptons.
Divya admits that she is practicing medicine without her parents' knowledge, stating that she is unhappy with the degree of control they try to exert over her, the most notorious example being forcing her to marry her childhood friend, an Indian man named Raj.
In episode 5, "No Man Is An Island", Divya reveals to Jill that she has tried to start a concierge physician service twice before, but failed both times.
She later is forced to tell her parents about her career after Evan practically told them everything (under the belief that they already knew).
They accept the news, but still expect her to marry Raj and leave the Hamptons, letting her reveal that she hates the fact that her parents never consider any of her ideas.
It was revealed that she first wanted to get into medicine when she was a little girl and helped take care of a cut on her friend.
When she told her parents they did not listen and told her that she would get an MBA, marry Raj, and work at his business.
In the last episode of the first season, she resolves to break off the engagement at the last minute.
She changes her mind, and becomes engaged to Raj.
In the second season, she becomes increasingly wary of her wedding, culminating in her becoming infatuated with Adam, one of HankMed's patients.
In the season finale, after she and Raj are exposed to pneumonic plague, Divya decides to call off her wedding once and for all, as she felt the universe had sent her "one sign too many" that she could not ignore.
In the 2011 season premiere, Divya broke the news to her parents that she and Raj had broken off their engagement.
Divya's mother tries to convince her to beg Raj to take her back.
She tells her parents that she refuses to go along with their wishes and wants to marry for love instead, which upsets her father.
In the episode "But There's a Catch", all signs point to the fact that Divya has been financially cut off by her parents after refusing to go through with the marriage, as her credit (which was still in her father's name) was refused when buying supplies for HankMed, her car was repossessed, and Evan finds out that she has not cashed any of the checks paid to her through the practice.
Hank and Evan allow Divya to stay with them until she gets back on her feet, even going so far as to buy her a car.
Divya eventually moves into a place of her own, only to discover that Raj's parents expect her personally to pay off the expenses they put into the engagement and wedding.
Rather than sell her shares of HankMed to them, as they had intended, Divya takes a part-time shift at Hamptons Heritage to pay off the debt, but the mounting demands on her time juggling both jobs has serious consequences which cause her to resign of her own accord.
By the end of the third season, Evan comes up with a solution to her debt problem.
In season 4, Divya and Rafa got married in Las Vegas but in the season finale of season 4, Divya says they need to end it, as she burns their license.
It is revealed in episode one of season five that Divya is pregnant with Rafa's baby.
In "Bones to Pick" Divya falls in pain and is rushed to the hospital where she, Hank, Evan, and Paige discover that she has a sub-chorionic hemorrhage behind the placenta.
Jeremiah shows up at the hospital to see Divya after Evan calls him to talk to Divya.
Everyone else leaves the room and Jeremiah admits his feelings to Divya.
When Divya is put on bedrest, Jeremiah offers to take care of her, since she lives with him.
Divya worries that he may still be in love with her and she says she doesn't want to take advantage of him, but Jeremiah says that he's outgrown his original feelings for her but that he hasn't outgrown his friendship with her.
In season 6, Divya has a party for her newborn little girl and the "army of random Hampton notables" her father invited.
In the season 7 finale, Divya and Raj attend the funeral rites of her grandmother.
Later, Raj and Divya admit that they love each another; he proposes to Divya and she accepts.
She is also accepted at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and begins studying to become a full-fledged doctor.
In the closing epilogue scene, Evan discusses the HankMed schedule with Hank, disclosing that Divya is still a member of HankMed.
Boris Kuester von Jurgens-Ratenicz (Campbell Scott): A mysterious (seemingly) German nobleman with a large estate in the Hamptons (filmed at Long Island's Oheka Castle).
In the series' pilot, Hank saves the life of April, a guest at Boris's party and Boris rewards Hank with a bar of solid gold, a job as concierge doctor, and use of his guest house.
He has apparently referred several of Hank's patients to him and admits to "having plans" for Hank.
Boris is extremely secretive, having moved to the Hamptons specifically to stay out of the public eye.
Boris sometimes uses his money to bend and break rules.
He owns a shark which was being used in a medical experiment and injures one of the scientists in one episode.
Hank states after a physical examination that Boris is in almost perfect physical health, yet Hank knows that something is wrong.
It is later discovered that Boris has a genetic disease that has affected, at least, the past three generations of his family.
The condition causes a lack of muscle control, degenerating brain function, and death around the age of 44.
Boris is somewhat cavalier about experimentation to cure his disease; this has led to unintended side effects such as muscle spasms and temporary blindness from not heeding Hank's advice.
In season two, Boris agrees to let Hank "quarterback" a cooperative effort between all of Boris's former doctors and researchers.
In "Medusa" they fly to Cuba to consult her; having diagnosed the condition, she allows for Boris to enter a clinical trial on the condition.
While Hank suggests further research to confirm its success and validity, Boris begins treatment the next day.
During a code blue where Boris crashes and needs to reboot, which loses the data for the trial but keeps him alive.
He later decides to stay for an extended period to reconnect to Marisa, and he announces his news that Marisa will be defecting upon his return in "Whole Lotto Love".
However, by the end episode it seems that she was arrested and detained, leaving a distressed, helpless Boris.
At one point, Jill drops Boris's name in an attempt to prevent the hospital board's closing down her free clinic in an attempt to take it over; the stratagem works, but at the cost of losing Boris as a donor, as his privacy as an anonymous donor was violated.
He is seen in the half-season finale flying out in a helicopter, despite his weakness, and retrieving Marisa from custody by unknown means.
Also as a precaution against Eddie, he begins an investigation into the Lawsons to determine their implicitness in Eddie's role as a confidential informant, using his aide Catherine (Rena Sofer) posing as a patient.
His findings are revealed to the family, which resulted in Eddie's heart attack.
When it seems certain that Eddie will be convicted and sentenced to prison, he offers to have Eddie spirited out of the country and beyond extradition, but he makes it clear to Eddie that he is doing this for Hank and Evan's benefit because he believes that the brothers will be better off without Eddie in their lives.
When he learns that Marisa is pregnant with his child and that Hank knew but did not tell him, he evicts Hank and Evan from his summer house.
However, realizing his rashness and accepting the strength of Hank's ethics, he asks Hank to come back in season three and HankMed moves back into the summer house.
Hank discovers that Boris was poisoned with thallium, which caused, among other things, muscle spasms.
The diagnosis was made on the basis of Boris's blood causing Hank's bare hand to tingle.
The poison was found in the swimming pool, and Dieter was nowhere to be found.
They discuss the possibility that Boris's family inheritance of illness may have been the result of "family politics."
Things become more complicated when a member of Boris's family comes for a visit, bringing hopes of reconciliation.
Boris is involved with Dimitri in a secret, multinational operation in Season 4.
In the episode "Off-Season's Greetings", it is hinted that he faked his own death in an explosion at Shadow Pond.
In one episode Boris mentions visiting his family in Klein-Walsertal, Austria.
Paige Lawson (née Collins) (Brooke D'Orsay): An upper-class girl who pays Evan to pretend to be her boyfriend while she has a relationship with a much older man.
She is somewhat domineering, as is her father, who is a retired general.
She is also naive, and believes that any problem can be solved by money.
She engages in many hobbies befitting her high social status including hunting, painting, golf, and surfing, and has a long list of connections she can call upon.
Her first appearance, "Comfort's Overrated", was when her boyfriend Graham, a man in his 50s, was injured in a surfing accident.
She attempts to hire Hank as a "faux-beau", a fake boyfriend to cover from her parents who are questioning her lack of evidence of having a boyfriend.
While Hank declines, Evan manages to convince her to hire him, which leads to a day of makeovers and photo shoots.
During this, Evan begins to fall in love with her, which Paige fails to or refuses to consider.
Graham breaks up with her as he leaves for his African photo shoot, wishing that she did not feel the need to hide him from her parents.
However, her "faux-beau" diversion was still in effect, and in "Frenemies" Evan is taken to meet her parents.
When her father blindsides them by taking them to a year-round hunting grounds, and Evan's inadequacy leads to him being (minorly) injured.
After realizing Evan's dedication to her, and hearing his heartfelt, unrehearsed speech on her own dedications, she decides to take him out for dinner.
After some major ups and downs in their relationship, at the end of the second season she invites Evan to join her in a trip to Europe and at Hank's urging he agrees.
In the third season, Evan proposed to Paige.
In the 4th season, Paige found out she was adopted.
At the season 4 finale, Paige and Evan got married.
They get married with Eddie as the minister (his license from the internet) which turns out, in season 5, to not be legal in the Hamptons township bylaws.
In the fifth season, Paige is offered a job for a few months in Paris, just after Evan is elected into the township council.
Paige says she thinks they need distance from everything that is getting in the way of their marriage.
Evan finally acts like an adult and puts his and Paige's relationship above his own ambitions.
Paige says that Kristoff can go to Paris and she'll stay here with Evan but the first thing they need to do is to get legally married and go to marriage counseling (as Evan says at the same time that they should go on their honeymoon).
They then agree that they should go on a honeymoon.
In the sixth season, Hank offers his spare room, but Paige and Evan rent a new home and insist that Emma stay with them.
This causes tension, as they begin to feel very cramped in such a small space with three people.
Their landlord helps them realise mid-squabble, that Paige and Evan tend to put others needs above their own and they "do this to ourselves."
They tell Emma and she says she completely understands and agrees to move into Hank's spare room.
One of the plotlines in the final two seasons is her and Evan's struggle to become pregnant, a goal made difficult because of Evan's low sperm count and motility, culminating in Season 8 in an In vitro fertilisation that, despite some premature false alarms to the negative from a home pregnancy kit, prove successful.
Dr. Jeremiah Sacani (Ben Shenkman) is one of the two physicians brought to HankMed by Evan after Hank temporarily resigns.
He often is uncomfortable around people, preferring to distance himself to the point that he memorized his patients by Social Security Number rather than by name.
He is shown to have a small amount of hero worship for Hank, whom he desperately wants to impress.
He falls in love with Divya, very early on after he is hired, but she is unaware and it is so difficult to work with her while she's dating Rafa that he leaves to go on a research trip to Iceland.
When Divya's house needs to go under construction to get rid of a toxic mold and to add a window to her walk-in closet for her new nursery, Jeremiah offers to share his home with Divya.
He, at first, finds it very difficult to share his personal space with her when she tries to add a little homey touch to the kitchen by adding a bouquet of flowers and a throw.
It isn't until season 5's "Bones to Pick" that Jeremiah admits to Divya how much he cares for her and her friendship.
When Divya is put on bedrest, Jeremiah offers to take care of her, since she already still lives with him.
Divya worries that he may still be in love with her and she says she doesn't want to take advantage of him, but Jeremiah says that he's outgrown his original feelings for her but that he hasn't outgrown his friendship with her.
Also in the 5th season, Jeremiah officially resigns from HankMed after feeling like he was manipulated and used by Hank when Hank asked him for a prescription for pain medication after his head surgery.
Hank offers Jeremiah another option: that he can work at HankMed but never have to work with Hank because Jeremiah would be in charge, not Hank.
In season 6, Jeremiah struggles with living with Divya and her new baby because the baby is so messy, chaotic, and keeps burping on him (he even goes so far as to go into his closet and yell into a pillow to let out his frustrations).
After Hank gets back from being a helicopter doctor, he asks Jeremiah if he wants to continue being the HankMed Director, which Jeremiah says he does.
Jeremiah begins frequenting a pub for lunch and seems to be building feelings for Viviana, the bartender at the pub.
In the series finale epilogue, it is revealed that Jeremiah is still a member of HankMed.
She is an executive-level administrator at Hamptons Heritage, the area hospital looked down upon by the elite (who have a running gag stating how it is a death trap or "taco stand"), because it had saved her arm after a teenage surfing accident.
Hank and Jill meet in the first season opener while leaving Boris's party and again when Hank is dealing with "New Parts" Newberg; at the end of the episode, Jill and Hank's love and career interests blossom at a clam shack.
For the first three episodes Jill drives a well-aged Saab 900 Turbo convertible essentially identical to Hank's car, but replaces it with a new Toyota Prius after her Saab "dies".
She describes Hank as "cute", as she says in episode 2 while she is drunk, and again at the end of the episode, when not drunk.
She is often worried that her relationship with Hank will turn out like her other relationships, all of which were disasters.
In episode 7 she reveals that she gave her ex-husband (Charlie) an ultimatum, either her or his job, he chose his job and left her.
It is later revealed she is still legally married to Charlie, because with all his travels she could never locate him to give him the papers to sign.
In the last episode of the first season, she was going to tell Hank she wanted to be with him, she sees him with another girl (his patient for the episode) and gets the wrong idea.
She later kicks Charlie out of her house at the end of the first season.
She left the show to organize hospitals in Africa, thus fulfilling her dream of helping the poor.
In Season 8 in the series' 100th episode "Doubt of Africa", she returns to the Hamptons for a visit.
In the series finale, Hank leaves the Hamptons to travel to Africa to see her, and their relationship is rekindled.
In the episode epilogue, it is revealed that she and Hank are now married and still working in Africa (although they will be spending the summer in the Hamptons working at HankMed and spending time with their whole family).
She has a podcast and believes in schmoozing her patients much more than Hank does.
She is hired by Boris as a substitute for Hank during his (extended) stay in Cuba, and Divya has trouble putting up with her.
She later moves to the Hamptons, claiming that the Hamptons are big enough for the both of them, leading to conflict when she attempts to secure her own position through aggressive marketing.
She eventually leaves to San Diego during "Big Whoop" to deal with family.
She is more cautious socially, legally and pragmatically, as she refuses to react to calls for a doctor unless she can be sure it would not legally endanger her.
Her attitude to medicine leads to many conflicts; rather than using the most medically sound practice, she would rather use a more well-received treatment to keep her patients liking her.
Nevertheless, her perfectionism leads to hold all in high standards, including herself; any clinical error she makes she finds distressing.
She and Hank carry on a relationship for portions of the second season, but the relationship ends when Emily is either unwilling or unable to share of herself with Hank as much as he hoped.
Tucker Bryant is the teenage great-grandson of the inventor (Marshall David Bryant II) of the blender (in reality, the blender was invented by Stephen J. Poplawski) and Libby is his girlfriend.
Tucker and Libby were injured when Tucker crashed his father's Ferrari F430.
Libby's injuries are mild, but she proves to be a cyberchondriac and thanks to the Internet is prone to bouts of medical babbling.
She is also a health nut, prompting Tucker to state, "she has food so fresh you can taste the dirt"; Tucker describes Libby as "a handful" but quickly adds "but the best usually are."
Hank discovers that Tucker, who was more severely wounded, is a hemophiliac, which complicates his injuries.
Hank performs a "MacGyver"-like procedure to stabilize him (such procedures are pretty commonplace in the series).
Hank later befriends the young couple, despite a stern rebuke from Tucker's wealthy father, Marshall David Bryant IV.
The elder Bryant, however, is rarely home, which causes Hank to become a surrogate father to Tucker.
The couple is almost broken up by Evan's bad advice to Tucker on trust in male/female relationships, but ultimately remain together.
Later in season two, in the episode "In Vino Veritas", it is revealed that Tucker's father is a substance abuser (after a severe withdrawal overseen by Hank, Tucker takes his father to a rehab center in New Canaan, Connecticut) and that Tucker's grandfather has "cut off" Tucker's father.
In season three, in the episode "An Apple A Day", Hank must treat Libby's divorced, bisexual mother Elyse (Julie Benz), who has trouble healing from an injury due to scurvy.
At some time between seasons 4 and 8, revealed in the series finale episode "Uninterrupted," Tucker and Libby split up permanently and Libby, her cyberchondria now totally controlled, becomes involved in humanitarian causes.
He is rarely home, leaving Tucker to fend for himself.
He is also domineering, and does not like it when Hank or Tucker stand up to him.
In one episode, he is revealed to have a substance abuse problem.
Marshall attempts to use a rapid detoxification program, which almost kills him, yet he continues to use drugs.
Tucker responds by telling his father that what he wants for his birthday present is for his father to get clean, and he is last seen being driven by Tucker to a detox center.
In the second season it is revealed that he has been cut off from his money by his father and all the money has been left to Tucker.
He is portrayed as a pompous jerk unable to take no for an answer, yet seemingly liked among the higher staff, where Jill once stated, "through any disaster he has come out of clean, leaving me to clean up the mess".
When things do not work out with Jill, she gives him an ultimatum to choose between her and his job, and he chooses his job.
When Jill attempts to file for divorce, Charlie flees the country to invalidate it, though when he returns, he hints that he might let the divorce go through, yet he repeatedly postpones signing it to try to woo her.
He is alluded to in several episodes, most of the times being brought up by Jill when Hank does something that reminds her of Charlie and makes her believe she is making the same mistake again.
Charlie eventually makes an appearance halfway through the first season, when he confronts Jill and gets brambles removed by Hank.
He also gets his old job back at Hamptons Heritage.
He is trying to win Jill back, which complicates things with Jill and Hank and hinders their relationship for a while.
In the first season finale, she kicks Charlie out of her house after he lies to her.
It is also revealed he quit from Hamptons Heritage and moved away.
Dr. Elizabeth Blair (Marcia Gay Harden): A surgeon and board member at Hamptons Heritage Hospital who is a mentor-turned-adversary to Jill.
After the resignation of Charlie, Blair believes Jill is a liability to the hospital.
She becomes one of Hank's clients when her son develops carbon monoxide poisoning from an improperly vented hot tub.
In the second season, she often tries to interfere with Jill's free clinic proposal, although she claims it is because of the board's decision.
Raj Bandyopadhyay (Rupak Ginn): Divya's fiancee from an arranged marriage at the beginning of the series.
Divya broke off the engagement at the end of season 2 partly for the need for independence and partly because she felt she and Raj were not fated for one another.
They reconnected in season 7 after each had a failed marriage and children and were finally married.
Ms. "New Parts" Newberg (Christine Ebersole): A middle-aged woman who is always having cosmetic surgery that turns out badly.
In the first episode, when one of her saline implants fails, Hank empties her other implant to make both breasts even.
In the third episode, Evan signs her to a summer-long retainer for a large amount of money.
However, she cares deeply for anyone who works for her, referring to them as family, even using her retainer to have Hank take care of her maid.
She is also obsessed with her dog Koufax, and throws a "bark mitzvah" for him.
She has been married at least three times to a lawyer, a doctor and a banker.
She has a stepdaughter named Blake and at least one granddaughter.
In season two, it is revealed that she has begun a relationship with Eddie Lawson.
Although Hank and Evan are skeptical, it seems that the relationship has a positive effect on Eddie, though Newberg sometimes assumes the persona of an overbearing stepmother.
In between seasons two and three, Ms. Newberg allowed Hank and Evan to stay at her mansion and operate their business after they were evicted from Boris' summer house (she resides in Manhattan outside the summer).
He is discussed extensively in season one.
During Hank's adolescence and Evan's childhood, he walked out on the family when their mother was dying.
Evan has been able to reconcile himself with his father's legacy, but Hank has pointedly not.
At the end of season one, Evan lends all of HankMed's capital to Eddie, which almost bankrupts HankMed and leads to a rift between Hank and Evan.
He makes his first on-screen appearance in the season two opener, when he returns some of Hank and Evan's money, to which Hank responds by punching him in the face.
By the next episode, he has returned all of the money and has begun a relationship with "New Parts" Newberg.
Though Hank asks Eddie to leave The Hamptons (as he is causing him too much trouble), he decides to stay.
He attempts to be a good father to his children, but often misses the mark.
He attempts to pull some sort of con on Boris, which later turns out to be spying on him for the Securities and Exchange Commission in return for a reduced fraud sentence.
It is a devastating blow to him when he is actually convicted and sentenced to prison.
He accepts Boris' offer of escape but in a last-minute change of heart agrees to stay and serve his sentence.
In season three, he is conditionally released on a special work program, one of the conditions of which is the wearing of an ankle bracelet and night-time confinement at his sponsor's house–the sponsor in question being his estranged father (Ed Asner).

In common with other contemporary submarines, they feature air-independent propulsion.
The first was planned to enter service in 2015, and the second in 2016, but "weight imbalance problems" delayed the project for 7 years.
The lead ship in the class, the Isaac Peral (S-81), is under construction, and is expected to be delivered by December 2022.
The S-80 class has also been offered for export.
The S-80's AIP (air independent propulsion) system is based on a bioethanol-processor (provided by Hynergreen from Abengoa) consisting of a reaction chamber and several intermediate Coprox reactors, that will transform the BioEtOH into high purity hydrogen.
The output feeds a series of fuel cells from UTC Power company.
The Reformator is fed with bioethanol as fuel, and oxygen (stored as a liquid in a high pressure cryogenic tank), generating hydrogen and carbon dioxide as subproducts.
The produced hydrogen and more oxygen is fed to the fuel cells.
The bioethanol-processor also produces a stream of highly concentrated carbon dioxide and other trace gases that are not burned completely during combustion.
This gas flow is mixed with sea water in one or more ejector venturi scrubbers and then through a new system called SECO (or CO Removal System), developed by Bionet, and whose purpose is to dissolve the "bubbles" of CO in water to undetectable levels.
The oxygen and fuel flow rates are directly determined by the demand for power.
A permanent-magnet electric motor moves a fixed propeller of a special design, that doesn't create cavitations at high speed.
In the 1980s France began studies for the replacement of their S-60 "Daphné"-class diesel submarines.
The French shipyard DCNI came up with an all-new design called S-80, with a teardrop hull and new weapons and sensors, which their government decided not to fund.
DCNI then proposed a cheaper option called the S-90B, an S-70 "Agosta"-class submarine with limited improvements which was again rejected by the French but which was exported to Pakistan.
Meanwhile, Spain faced the same problem in replacing their "Daphné"s, known as the "Delfín" class in Spanish service, as part of Plan ALTAMAR.
Bazán (later Izar, and then Navantia) started on a new design but when it started to look like the S-80, it was agreed to collaborate in a joint venture based on the French S-80.
This joint design was shown at Le Bourget Navale in October 1990.
The end of the Cold War meant that funding dried up and the joint venture had to wait until 1997 for their first sale - to Chile - of the new design, which was designated the in export markets.
The same year Spain started to look again at its requirements, and in 1998 they indicated that they would buy four Scorpènes, optionally with an air-independent propulsion (AIP) system for greater endurance when submerged.
A staff requirement for the S-80 Scorpène variant was completed in October 2001.
This was soon overtaken by events, as the Armada (navy) became more interested in using submarines for power projection than in a more static, defensive role.
This shift was codified in guidance of January 2002 from the Chief of Naval Operations and in the strategic defence review of February 2003.
The new requirement called for a larger submarine with better endurance and land-attack missiles, which became known as the S-80A design.
This was an AIP submarine with a hull diameter of compared to for the Scorpène family, a submerged displacement of around 2,400 tonnes versus 1,740 tonnes, larger rudder surfaces and a different fin position.
The Spanish government approved the purchase of four S-80A submarines in September 2003 and signed a contract with Izar on 24 March 2004.
The original deal was €1,756m to design and build four submarines, about €439m per boat, but by 2010 this had increased to €2,212m (€553m/boat).
The plan envisaged the first boat to be delivered in 2011 but government dithering over who should supply the combat system pushed it back to 2013.
In 2011 Spain's budget crisis further delayed the first delivery until 2015, with the remaining boats being delivered at one year intervals until 2018.
Construction of S-81 began on 13 December 2007.
In January 2012 the names were announced, honouring three engineers who made submarines and the first commander of Spain's submarine force respectively - Isaac Peral (S-81), Narciso Monturiol (S-82), Cosme García (S-83) and Mateo García de los Reyes (S-84).
In May 2013, Navantia announced that a serious weight imbalance design flaw had been identified which will delay the delivery of the first submarine to the Spanish Navy until possibly 2017.
Excess weight of 75 - 100 tons has been added to the sub during construction and the current design is not able to resurface after diving.
A former Spanish official says the problem can be traced to a miscalculation — someone apparently put a decimal point in the wrong place or by the addition of new technologic devices.
Lengthening the submarine would create additional buoyancy, though at a cost of €7.5m per metre.
With the project also suffering with an underperforming AIP system (which was to allow the submarine to stay underway for 28 days but was only managing 21 days) the Spanish Defence Ministry announced in June 2013 that Navantia has signed on the US company General Dynamics Electric Boat to help solve the excess weight.
In September 2014, the detected overweight was reported to have been resolved and the construction work to be ready to resume in late October 2014.
In November 2014, Navantia again reported having completed the redesign work to address the problem of overweight.
In all, the hull will be lengthened by seven metres, and the displacement increased by 75 tons.
, the intended delivery date of the first submarine is September 2022.
In January 2017, it was reported that the AIP system would not be ready in time for the delivery of the first submarine.
The Indian Navy considered the S-80 for its next generation of submarines under Project 75I.
The Kammel originates west of Mindelheim, in the district Unterallgäu, and flows generally north.
It flows into the Mindel (left tributary) south of "Offingen at the Danube", east of Günzburg in the district Günzburg.
Municipalities which are passed by the Kammel are (from south to north):
in the district Unterallgäu: Stetten, Kammlach, Oberrieden, Pfaffenhausen and Breitenbrunn;
The name of the Kammel derives from the Celtic "kamb" or "camb" which means crooked.
Other authors are of the opinion that Kammel means bog.
It is found from southern Wyoming to Durango, Mexico.
Born in London, the son of John Wilcoxon Rooth, barrister-at-law (1835–1874), and Elizabeth Cody (1825–1917), daughter of Henry Smith of Bristol.
He was born in January 1869 and baptised 20 January at St Paul's Church, Camden Square.
He was educated at Highgate School and University College University of Oxford where he read history (BA 1890).
He was best known as the doctor in charge of the delivery of future vaudevillian and film actors Violet and Daisy Hilton, conjoined twins born in Brighton in 1908 and the first to live to adulthood.
He provided a medical testimony of them for the "British Medical Journal" in 1911.
He died in Hove, Sussex, in 1963.
Urbanspoon was a restaurant information and recommendation service founded in 2006 by former Jobster employees that offered its services in North America and parts of English-speaking Australasia and Europe.
In January 2015, Zomato, an India-based restaurant search and discovery service, acquired Urbanspoon.
The Urbanspoon website and Seattle business operation initially evolved with addition of content team workers for door-to-door data collection of restaurant information, an operational design that had served Zomato well in India.
However, Zomato discontinued the Urbanspoon website on June 1, 2015, redirecting Urbanspoon traffic to Zomato servers; at the same time, Urbanspoon's logo was incorporated into a new Zomato logo.
Zomato ceased earlier Urbanspoon app development, leading to departure of all Seattle engineers by August 2015.
Mid-October 2015, multiple U.S. Zomato (previously Urbanspoon) offices were closed, including the former corporate headquarters in Seattle.
Business reports as of October 2015 indicate either that Zomato-Urbanspoon has ceased all U.S. operations, or that it will retain a couple of sites, including Dallas, the new site of Zomato's U.S. administrative functions.
Urbanspoon was a restaurant information and recommendation service that operated in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, and in the United Kingdom and Ireland.
It offered services via its website and standard apps for mobile operating systems.
In its evolution from an initial and popular iPhone application, UrbanSpoon adapted its appearance and capabilities, including to the Android market.
In these and other efforts to develop the product, the results were apps that were aware and competitive with alternative businesses Yelp and Where.
Via its apps and webpage, Urbanspoon offered a restaurant search utility, with filtering by price, type of food, neighborhood, nearby businesses (movie theaters, sports venues, etc.), and special features (gluten-free fare, child-friendliness, BYOB-service, etc.).
Users could then participate in the simple "like" or "don’t like" rating system to review restaurants, and share restaurant information with friends via email, Facebook, Google+, Twitter, and Pinterest, and by photo pages.
Users who create an account could track dining experiences (menu items, price of meal, and photos), and could create a "Wishlist" to save restaurants for future use and a "Guide" to share personal lists of dining favorites.
In addition, the Urbanspoon app featured a "Slot Machine," allowing users to "Spin" (or shake their device) to randomly see a new eating establishment based on neighborhood, cuisine, or price.
The Urbanspoon website evolved in response to the Zomato acquisition, adding content based on the work of new team workers doing door-to-door data collection of restaurant information (menus, hours, etc.), an operational design that had served Zomato well in India.
Zomato discontinued operation of the Urbanspoon website on June 1, 2015 (redirecting Urbanspoon search traffic to Zomato website servers), and rolled out a new Zomato logo that incorporated the earlier logo of Urbanspoon; hence, as of this date, Urbanspoon services ceased to exist.
Urbanspoon was acquired from its former Jobster employees Ethan Lowry, Adam Doppelt, and Patrick O’Donnell by American media and internet business InterActiveCorp (IAC) in April 2009.
It launched RezBook in 2011, an online reservation booking service for restaurants.
OpenTable purchased the RezBook venture and capabilities from Urbanspoon for an undisclosed sum in 2013.
Urbanspoon was then acquired in an all-cash deal by Zomato, an Indian restaurant search and discovery service, in January 2015.
Its location has been based since its inception in Seattle, Washington, where the company was founded.
Urbanspoon offered Zomato an annual user base estimated to be approximately 31 million in early 2015 based on app downloads, and a directory of >1 million restaurants; Zomato's intention, based on information from its CEO, Deepinder Goyal, as reported by John Cook of "GeekWire," is to give the company "a nice footprint" as it expands in preparation to "battle industry heavyweight Yelp."
Goyal is reported to have said: "'The biggest challenge and most fun part of this move, however, is the fight we’re going to be picking with Yelp, … [i]n the market they have dominated for so long.
After all, like Mark Twain famously said, it isn’t the size of the dog in the fight, it’s the size of the fight in the dog."
Zomato reportedly will integrate the Urbanspoon app and Web site over the next few months [of early 2015], "meaning the Urbanspoon brand will be phased out."
Goyal has further stated, as reported by "The Seattle Times," that a result of the acquisition will likely be a downsizing of Urbanspoon in Seattle (by ≈10% of its employees), and "phase out its popular restaurant-finding app."
Goyal has acknowledged that Urbanspoon was a valuable brand and that Zomato would lose brand equity in the short-term, but that uniformity of product was an aim, and that "to manage two brands within the same company" would be "harder for us [Zomato] in the longer term."
On June 1, 2015 Zomato discontinued the Urbanspoon website, redirecting Urbanspoon traffic to Zomato website servers; at the same time, a new Zomato logo incorporated the earlier logo of Urbanspoon.
These visible changes came alongside Zomato's business decision to cease app development, which led 12 engineers (two-third of its Seattle engineering workforce at time of acquisition) to leave between January and August 2015; the remaining engineers were laid off on August 6.
Further extensive cuts in the U.S. workforce were made in mid-October 2015, with the closing of multiple U.S. Zomato (previously Urbanspoon) offices, including the former corporate headquarters in Seattle.
This layoff of the remainder of what was a workforce of 150 in the U.S., at San Francisco, Chicago, Denver, Dallas, Philadelphia, and New York offices, led former employees to report that the company has ceased all U.S. operations, with a Zomato source refining the report to say that some workers will be retained at a couple of sites, including Dallas, the new site of Zomato's U.S. administrative functions.

Ricky Lundell is a Gracie (Brazilian) Jiu Jitsu 3rd degree black belt under Pedro Sauer and considered by many to be his most technical black belt.
Ricky started jiu-jitsu at age six and is credited with being the youngest North American to receive the rank of black belt in Gracie (Brazilian) Jiu-Jitsu (age 19 when received).
He was the smallest person to win the absolute division of Pancrase by over 20 lbs and submitted Brandon Ruiz who is a 2x FILA Silver Medalist in the heavyweight division (265 lbs) who was on 2 USA World Teams with Ricky.
Ricky Lundell won the World Team Trials and took home MOG (Most Outstanding Grappler) award in 2007 and 2008.
He represented the USA for Grappling 2x and is a 2x FILA World Championship in Submission Grappling under FILA (International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles), the same organization that oversees Olympic wrestling.
Ricky started College at Utah Valley University when he was 15 years old and graduated with a science degree at 18.
He was recruited by Cody and Cael Sanderson as a college senior to wrestle for Iowa State University at the age of 20.
He is the 1st D1 Wrestler to ever be recruited having only jiu-jitsu/submission grappling experience and no folkstyle match experience.
Despite the NCAA's refusal to give Ricky any eligibility to start for the team at ISU, Ricky lettered in wrestling and went on to win the USA World Team Trials where he won the Most Outstanding Grappler award and won the FILA Grappling World Championship while on the Cyclones team.
Ricky holds notable wins over several world champions including Nicolas Renier, Tom Lecuyer, Brandon Ruiz, Alberto Crane and Jeff Glover, both in no-gi submission grappling tournaments.
horse thief, highwayman, and river pirate, who was believed to be the associate of serial-killer, Little Harpe and partner, in the murder of notorious outlaw, leader Samuel Mason in 1803.
Alston was also, the son of the colonial-era counterfeiter, Philip Alston, associated with Cave-in-Rock, Illinois, and Natchez, Mississippi.
Peter Alston was born the son of the notorious counterfeiter.
When and where he was born and where he grew up is not known, as there is scant information on his childhood and pre-criminal activities.
He may have been born in South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Natchez, West Florida, now Natchez, Mississippi, Fort Nashborough, Virginia, now Nashville, Tennessee, or Russellville, Virginia, now Russellville, Kentucky.
Having been the son of an outlaw, Peter Alston probably moved wherever his father hastily moved their family, remaining as far away from the pursuit of the law.
According to Alex C. Finley, in "The History of Russellville and Logan County, Ky", Peter Alston used the alias "James May", as Wiley Little Harpe had used the name "John Setton", as his alias.
The earliest recorded use of the Peter Alston alias, James May, dated back to around 1797 or 1798, in Red Banks, Kentucky, now Henderson, Henderson County, Kentucky, where Alston appeared, with a woman, who claimed to be his lame sister, which could have been, one of his two sisters, Francis or Elizabeth.
While at the Red Banks, Alston stole horses, but was caught in Vincennes, Northwest territory, now Vincennes, Indiana, and brought back for trial.
Peter Alson was never tried, as he broke out of jail the first night he was incarcerated.
Peter Alston later shifted his operations down river to Stack Island, on the lower Mississippi River, along with Samuel Mason, the notorious outlaw gang leader, after regulators cleaned the frontier criminal element out of western Kentucky and Cave-in-Rock, Northwest territory, now Cave-in-Rock, Illinois, in the summer of 1799.
There Alston reunited with his father, Philip, and cast counterfeit silver coins, as well as taking part in Mason's river piracy operations.
Mason was captured in 1803, and was transported overland from New Orleans towards the Mississippi Territory for trial.
He escaped "en route", sustaining a gunshot wound in the process, and may have made his way back to his former gang.
Mississippi territoreial Governor William C. C. Claiborne posted a $2,200 reward for Mason's recapture, which Alston and Harpe attempted to claim under the assumed names of "James May" and "John Setton."
In so doing they presented Mason's severed head as proof that he was no longer at large.
Their true identities were quickly discovered and both men were arrested for Mason's murder.
Convicted and sentenced to death on February 4, 1804, they were hanged four days later.
Their own heads were cut off and placed on poles, along the Natchez Trace.
Johns Cove is a small bay located on the Cape Forchu peninsula in the Municipality of Yarmouth, Nova Scotia.
The cove is located in Yarmouth Sound and until the cancellation of the service in 2009 the CAT Ferry could be seen arriving and departing Yarmouth Harbour.
Johns Cove is located 4 kilometers away from the town of Yarmouth.
Johns Cove is named after Cornelius John Fox who was the second lighthouse keeper of the Cape Forchu Lighthouse in 1841.
The beach was important because it sheltered fishermen from the sea and enabled them to haul their boats up on shore for repairs.
Nytheatre.com was a theatre information and review website founded in 1997.
It ended operations in 2017.
It was dedicated to reviewing and promoting indie theater in New York City, New York.
In 2000, "The Washington Post" recommended it to "dedicated fans" of live theater.
In 2001, "The Salt Lake Tribune" wrote that the website makes "sampling Manhattan's amazing cornucopia of theater offerings easier than ever before".
In 2005, Gothamist wrote that "theatre fans have for some time been able to get at least some idea about the next year on stage, and not only the brand-name productions, via the estimable nytheatre.com".
In 2007, the "Cincinnati CityBeat" called the site "An excellent reference source.
It has up-to-date accounts of strike-affected productions, plus an always reliable list of shows outside the theater district.
nytheatre.com, through the NYTE Small Press, also published an annual collection of plays called Plays and Playwrights from 2000 through 2011, featuring the work of a number of emerging and established writers whose work has been premiered in New York City.
Writers include Chiori Miyagawa, Julia Lee Barclay, Proto-type Theater's Peter S. Petralia, Trav S.D., Ken Urban and Marc Spitz.
This was supplemented by the electronic play publisher Indie Theater Now (2011-2017), which offered a large database of plays that could be downloaded from the site, including works by Kirk Bromley, Edward Einhorn, Ian W. Hill, Nat Cassidy, Jeffrey Sweet, Crystal Skillman and Mac Rogers.
