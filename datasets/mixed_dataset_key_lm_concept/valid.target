It has been called a 'credit-crunch generation Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'
Lauren was the EPC contractor on the 64 MW Nevada Solar One parabolic trough project near Las Vegas, Nevada which was completed in 2007 after just 16 months of construction.
It was one of the first pieces of theatre to examine the credit crunch and focused on an estranged husband and wife.
This was the first utility scale CSP project to be completed in the U.S. in 16 years.
The original performance was particularly notable for the staging where the play was performed in the round and the audience sat above the flat in which the play was set and looked down on the action.

In 2015 Lauren expanded its fabrication capabilities with acquisition of a 126,000 square foot pipe and vessel welding facility at the Port of Catoosa in Tulsa, Oklahoma with access to the US Inland Waterway.
She went on to say that "there are times when it is so raw and bloody, you want to avert your gaze", but failed to be convinced by the play's political and economic dimensions when "Dave and Joanne stop beating the hell out of each other and start spouting social-history textbooks."
Faces in the Crowd by Leo Butler was first performed at the Royal Court theatre in London in 2008.
Fiona Mountford of the Evening Standard described it as "the nearest theatre has yet come to a credit crunch play", commenting that "Butler worries at some weighty themes in his spare script, covering not only our have-now-pay-later culture but also the failure of feminist rhetoric when countered with the brutal facts of female biology."
The original cast had Amanda Drew and Con O'Neill directed by Clare Lizzimore.
However, she was frustrated that Butler's "theoretical arguments are not pushed far enough", but congratulated it as "a thrillingly no-holds-barred production, powered by commendably raw performances from Drew and O’Neill."
It has been called a 'credit-crunch generation Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'
Dominic Cavendish of The Daily Telegraph wrote that "Butler's outstanding new play - his best yet - catches the mood of the moment in its raw and devastating account of a couple who got swept along on a tide of easy credit, only to end up dashed against a northern rock of debt."
It was one of the first pieces of theatre to examine the credit crunch and focused on an estranged husband and wife.
Praising the "intensely pitiful scene that can shift in the space of a phrase from the bleakly funny to the unbearably excruciating", the reviewer went on to say that "I can't think of a recent play that catches so acutely the way that, while it may be tough up North, it can be grim down South too.
The original performance was particularly notable for the staging where the play was performed in the round and the audience sat above the flat in which the play was set and looked down on the action.

She also praised "the most full-frontally brave performances in London from Con O'Neill and Amanda Drew as the toxic ex-partners".
Toyota replaced the XV40 series in 2011 with the XV50.
She went on to say that "there are times when it is so raw and bloody, you want to avert your gaze", but failed to be convinced by the play's political and economic dimensions when "Dave and Joanne stop beating the hell out of each other and start spouting social-history textbooks."
Introduced at the January 2006 North American International Auto Show, the XV40 made its North American sales debut in March 2006 as a 2007 model.
Fiona Mountford of the Evening Standard described it as "the nearest theatre has yet come to a credit crunch play", commenting that "Butler worries at some weighty themes in his spare script, covering not only our have-now-pay-later culture but also the failure of feminist rhetoric when countered with the brutal facts of female biology."
For the first time, a gasoline/electric hybrid version of Camry was offered in addition to the naturally aspirated four- and six-cylinder engines.
However, she was frustrated that Butler's "theoretical arguments are not pushed far enough", but congratulated it as "a thrillingly no-holds-barred production, powered by commendably raw performances from Drew and O’Neill."
Like the previous XV30 model, the XV40 was offered in two distinct forms.
Dominic Cavendish of The Daily Telegraph wrote that "Butler's outstanding new play - his best yet - catches the mood of the moment in its raw and devastating account of a couple who got swept along on a tide of easy credit, only to end up dashed against a northern rock of debt."
The Camry sold in Australasia and North America was the same as the version available in Japan; the version sold in China and the majority of Southeast Asia was based on the Australian-designed Toyota Aurion (XV40).
Praising the "intensely pitiful scene that can shift in the space of a phrase from the bleakly funny to the unbearably excruciating", the reviewer went on to say that "I can't think of a recent play that catches so acutely the way that, while it may be tough up North, it can be grim down South too.
Like the previous XV30, the design of the XV40 series Toyota Camry was split into two separate configurations: "regular" and "prestige".
And with incredible deftness, Butler ponders the harsh predicament of women who flounder when they hit the glass ceiling of reproductive reality.
The "regular Camry" is sold in Australasia, Hong Kong, India, Japan, the Middle East, North America, and Russia.
This is a timely, savagely brilliant theatrical epitaph for the New Labour decade of shattered hopes and dreams turned sour."
However, the "prestige Camry" is an Australian-designed model sold alongside the "regular Camry" in Australasia and the Middle East as the Toyota Aurion.
The Toyota Camry (XV40) is a mid-size car that was produced by Toyota from January 2006 to July 2011.
China and most Southeast Asian countries also receive the Aurion, although it is badged "Toyota Camry" as the regular car is not offered those markets.
Replacing the XV30 series, the XV40 represented the sixth generation of the Toyota Camry in all markets outside Japan, which followed a different generational lineage.
Making its debut at the January 2006 North American International Auto Show, the XV40 Camry takes a sleeker shape compared to its predecessor.
Between 2006 and 2010, a badged engineered model called Daihatsu Altis sold alongside the Camry in Japan.
The design is based on Toyota's "vibrant clarity" corporate design language, with a three-bar grille and stepped hood and trunk.
Toyota replaced the XV40 series in 2011 with the XV50.
Development began in early-2002 under the chief engineer Kenichiro Fuse.
Introduced at the January 2006 North American International Auto Show, the XV40 made its North American sales debut in March 2006 as a 2007 model.
A final design was set in September 2003 and frozen in August 2004, 17 months ahead of production.
For the first time, a gasoline/electric hybrid version of Camry was offered in addition to the naturally aspirated four- and six-cylinder engines.
Design patents were filed on 27 December 2005 at the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
Like the previous XV30 model, the XV40 was offered in two distinct forms.
The XV40 was redesigned to incorporate a longer wheelbase, wider wheel tracks, and a stiffer body.
The Camry sold in Australasia and North America was the same as the version available in Japan; the version sold in China and the majority of Southeast Asia was based on the Australian-designed Toyota Aurion (XV40).
Although overall length is equal to its predecessor, Toyota maximized interior volume—especially fore-and-aft space.
The Aurion was essentially the same as the regular Camry, albeit, with revised front- and rear-end styling, and minor alterations to the interior.
This was achieved by moving the base of the windshield and rear glass outwards and by the redesigning of the front seats.
Like the previous XV30, the design of the XV40 series Toyota Camry was split into two separate configurations: "regular" and "prestige".
At , cargo space has been reduced by over the previous model.
The "regular Camry" is sold in Australasia, Hong Kong, India, Japan, the Middle East, North America, and Russia.
The SE/Sportivo provides due to the placement of bracing behind the rear seat, with the hybrid version falling to due to the placement of the battery pack.
However, the "prestige Camry" is an Australian-designed model sold alongside the "regular Camry" in Australasia and the Middle East as the Toyota Aurion.
The XV40's underbody is stepped, creating a venturi effect and hence a low-pressure area under the front end to increase downforce.
China and most Southeast Asian countries also receive the Aurion, although it is badged "Toyota Camry" as the regular car is not offered those markets.
Other aerodynamic design features include a stepped engine undercover and rear wheel fairings to channel airflow around the tires.
Making its debut at the January 2006 North American International Auto Show, the XV40 Camry takes a sleeker shape compared to its predecessor.
The coefficient of drag figure remains at 0.28, falling to 0.27 for the hybrid version (which makes it the most aerodynamic car built in Australia).
The design is based on Toyota's "vibrant clarity" corporate design language, with a three-bar grille and stepped hood and trunk.
The sports-oriented model, known as the "SE" in North America and "Sportivo" in Australasia, was developed by Toyota Australia.
The chief engineer for the XV40 was Kenichiro Fuse.
It features a black "honeycomb" grille, black-tinted head and fog lamps, rear lip spoiler, body kit appendages, and a lower ride height coupled with wider and larger 17-inch diameter wheels.
Development began in early-2002 under the chief engineer Kenichiro Fuse.
To increase rear-end downforce, the SE/Sportivo includes additional rear floor and fuel tank undercovers.
A final design was set in September 2003 and frozen in August 2004, 17 months ahead of production.
Handling-specific upgrades see the use of firmer shock absorbers, a rise in spring rate, thicker anti-roll bars, additional floor and body side bracing, and a "V"-brace behind the rear seat (which prevents the rear seat from folding down, offering a ski-pass only).
Design patents were filed on 27 December 2005 at the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
Interior changes include charcoal-colored sports fabric and a leather-wrapped three-spoke steering wheel.
The XV40 was redesigned to incorporate a longer wheelbase, wider wheel tracks, and a stiffer body.
In addition to the sports-oriented suspension setup, Toyota Australia's standard-grade suspension calibration has also been adopted by New Zealand, the Middle East and North America.
Although overall length is equal to its predecessor, Toyota maximized interior volume—especially fore-and-aft space.
The suspension geometry consists of independent MacPherson struts, L-arms, coil springs, gas dampers and a ball-jointed stabilizer bar at the front, with the rear setup comprising dual-link independent MacPherson struts with coil springs, gas dampers and ball-jointed stabilizer bar.
This was achieved by moving the base of the windshield and rear glass outwards and by the redesigning of the front seats.
Toyota introduced a refreshed "regular" Camry XV40 design in January 2009 at the North American International Auto Show.
At , cargo space has been reduced by over the previous model.
Visual changes include an updated front fascia, including grille and bumper with larger air intakes, larger projector headlamps, redesigned tail lamp lenses incorporating LEDs on all models (previously hybrids only), and revised wheel trims among other design changes.
The SE/Sportivo provides due to the placement of bracing behind the rear seat, with the hybrid version falling to due to the placement of the battery pack.
The interior received revised trim, improved power window switches, and a revamped audio system.
The XV40's underbody is stepped, creating a venturi effect and hence a low-pressure area under the front end to increase downforce.
The audio system now supports satellite radio (in North America) and added USB connectivity, with the dashboard-mounted screen now integrating a backup camera for models fitted with satellite navigation.
Other aerodynamic design features include a stepped engine undercover and rear wheel fairings to channel airflow around the tires.
The Camry sold in the majority of Southeast Asia, China, and Taiwan is referred to as the "prestige Camry" by Toyota officials in Japan.
The coefficient of drag figure remains at 0.28, falling to 0.27 for the hybrid version (which makes it the most aerodynamic car built in Australia).
The prestige Camry is a rebadged Toyota Aurion (XV40), a regional product designed in Australia and based on the regular Camry.
The sports-oriented model, known as the "SE" in North America and "Sportivo" in Australasia, was developed by Toyota Australia.
Although front and rear fascias are unique to the Aurion, the body sides including doors and rear quarters, the greenhouse, and roof are interchangeable with the regular Camry.
It features a black "honeycomb" grille, black-tinted head and fog lamps, rear lip spoiler, body kit appendages, and a lower ride height coupled with wider and larger 17-inch diameter wheels.
This component sharing also means that Aurion has the same wheelbase, axle tracks, and interior dimensions.
To increase rear-end downforce, the SE/Sportivo includes additional rear floor and fuel tank undercovers.
From the inside, the Aurion also shares a common interior design with the Camry, including an almost identical lower dashboard, but gaining a redesigned upper dash portion and revamped center console.
Handling-specific upgrades see the use of firmer shock absorbers, a rise in spring rate, thicker anti-roll bars, additional floor and body side bracing, and a "V"-brace behind the rear seat (which prevents the rear seat from folding down, offering a ski-pass only).
In the Middle East, the Aurion shares the dashboard with the regular Camry.
Interior changes include charcoal-colored sports fabric and a leather-wrapped three-spoke steering wheel.
Like the Camry, the Aurion was designed with Toyota's "vibrant clarity" design language.
In addition to the sports-oriented suspension setup, Toyota Australia's standard-grade suspension calibration has also been adopted by New Zealand, the Middle East and North America.
However, the Aurion also integrates a "vibrant clarity" theory known as "perfect imbalance" that involves body features that act as a counterpoint to other body features.
The suspension geometry consists of independent MacPherson struts, L-arms, coil springs, gas dampers and a ball-jointed stabilizer bar at the front, with the rear setup comprising dual-link independent MacPherson struts with coil springs, gas dampers and ball-jointed stabilizer bar.
Examples of this include intersecting concave and convex surfaces and vertical sculpted features on the front fascia, which are balanced by the horizontal headlamps.
Toyota introduced a refreshed "regular" Camry XV40 design in January 2009 at the North American International Auto Show.
The front-end's "double concave architecture" can also be characterized by its protruding hood crease line and deep grille.
Visual changes include an updated front fascia, including grille and bumper with larger air intakes, larger projector headlamps, redesigned tail lamp lenses incorporating LEDs on all models (previously hybrids only), and revised wheel trims among other design changes.
The same architecture is applied at the rear, with a deep bumper, a clamshell-shaped trunk lid that envelops over the flanks, dual exhaust pipes and tail lamps.
The interior received revised trim, improved power window switches, and a revamped audio system.
Known as the "Toyota Camry Hybrid", the gasoline–electric model premiered in January 2006—alongside the non-hybrid car.
The audio system now supports satellite radio (in North America) and added USB connectivity, with the dashboard-mounted screen now integrating a backup camera for models fitted with satellite navigation.
Camry Hybrids were initially built solely at the Tsutsumi plant in Toyota, Aichi, Japan, although the hybrid has never been available for purchase in its home market.
The Camry sold in the majority of Southeast Asia, China, and Taiwan is referred to as the "prestige Camry" by Toyota officials in Japan.
Since October 2006, models for the North American market shifted production to Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky in the United States.
The prestige Camry is a rebadged Toyota Aurion (XV40), a regional product designed in Australia and based on the regular Camry.
Toyota Australia began local manufacture of the hybrid on 11 December 2009 at its Altona, Victoria plant.
Although front and rear fascias are unique to the Aurion, the body sides including doors and rear quarters, the greenhouse, and roof are interchangeable with the regular Camry.
In Australasia, the car is known as the "Toyota Hybrid Camry", as opposed to "Camry Hybrid".
This component sharing also means that Aurion has the same wheelbase, axle tracks, and interior dimensions.
Since May 2009, the hybrid model has also been produced at Toyota Motor Thailand's Gateway plant in Chachoengsao.
From the inside, the Aurion also shares a common interior design with the Camry, including an almost identical lower dashboard, but gaining a redesigned upper dash portion and revamped center console.
Unlike the Camry Hybrid models produced elsewhere, the Thai models are based on the "prestige Camry" design.
In the Middle East, the Aurion shares the dashboard with the regular Camry.
As of August 2009, worldwide sales of the Camry Hybrid represent 8.3 percent of Toyota's total hybrid sales, ranking second after the Toyota Prius, with more than 167,000 Camry Hybrids sold.
Like the Camry, the Aurion was designed with Toyota's "vibrant clarity" design language.
As of December 2009 cumulative sales of the Camry Hybrid had reached 154,977 units in the US, placing it as the third best selling electric hybrid car in that market.
However, the Aurion also integrates a "vibrant clarity" theory known as "perfect imbalance" that involves body features that act as a counterpoint to other body features.
Compared to the gasoline-only variants, several features are unique to the hybrid.
Examples of this include intersecting concave and convex surfaces and vertical sculpted features on the front fascia, which are balanced by the horizontal headlamps.
In addition to the hybrid powertrain, the Camry Hybrid employs electric power steering, brakes, and air conditioning that are fully operational once the internal combustion engine is deactivated.
The front-end's "double concave architecture" can also be characterized by its protruding hood crease line and deep grille.
The car can run in an all-electric mode, gasoline-only or both.
The same architecture is applied at the rear, with a deep bumper, a clamshell-shaped trunk lid that envelops over the flanks, dual exhaust pipes and tail lamps.
A real-time dashboard screen shows power distribution and the operation of the hybrid system and the tachometer is replaced by an analog fuel economy readout.
The XV40 was the first Camry series available with a gasoline/electric hybrid drivetrain (see: below).
The hybrid drivetrain has also necessitated a redesigned front subframe, along with remodeled rear and center floor pressings.
Known as the "Toyota Camry Hybrid", the gasoline–electric model premiered in January 2006—alongside the non-hybrid car.
This was required to accommodate the battery pack, which is stowed in the trunk.
Camry Hybrids were initially built solely at the Tsutsumi plant in Toyota, Aichi, Japan, although the hybrid has never been available for purchase in its home market.
Other differences include wheel spats and underbody pans which reduce aerodynamic drag from 0.28 to 0.27 "c", an "Eco" operating mode for the HVAC system that reduces the output of air conditioning to assist fuel economy, and Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM).
Since October 2006, models for the North American market shifted production to Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky in the United States.
Cosmetic changes are limited to redesigned tail lights with LEDs, a chrome-lined grille, as opposed to the color-coded version on every other Camry trim, and hybrid-oriented emblems including "Hybrid" badging on the front fenders and a decklid-mounted "Hybrid Synergy Drive" logo.
Toyota Australia began local manufacture of the hybrid on 11 December 2009 at its Altona, Victoria plant.
For the facelifted version that debuted at the January 2009 North American International Auto Show, Toyota worked to better differentiate the styling of the hybrid away from the rest of the Camry range.
In Australasia, the car is known as the "Toyota Hybrid Camry", as opposed to "Camry Hybrid".
This was achieved by fitting a distinct front fascia with a large, central air dam, vertically slotted fog lamps, and a single-blade grille.
Since May 2009, the hybrid model has also been produced at Toyota Motor Thailand's Gateway plant in Chachoengsao.
From the rear, the tail lamps abstain from the primarily red lens inserts fitted previously, to predominantly clear lenses, while the interior receives a newly designed fuel economy gauge.
Unlike the Camry Hybrid models produced elsewhere, the Thai models are based on the "prestige Camry" design.
The design registrations for the facelifted Camry Hybrid, noting changes made to the original were filed on 19 December 2008 at the US Patent and Trademark Office.
As of August 2009, worldwide sales of the Camry Hybrid represent 8.3 percent of Toyota's total hybrid sales, ranking second after the Toyota Prius, with more than 167,000 Camry Hybrids sold.
Powertrain options for the Camry XV40 comprised both four- and six-cylinder engines with manual and automatic transmissions.
As of December 2009 cumulative sales of the Camry Hybrid had reached 154,977 units in the US, placing it as the third best selling electric hybrid car in that market.
For the Japanese market only, an all-wheel drive variant of the 2.4-liter engine was available, although a four-speed automatic was the sole transmission fitted.
Compared to the gasoline-only variants, several features are unique to the hybrid.
All other XV40 series Camrys utilize front-wheel drive.
In addition to the hybrid powertrain, the Camry Hybrid employs electric power steering, brakes, and air conditioning that are fully operational once the internal combustion engine is deactivated.
XV40s produced in the United States from January 2009 saw the 2.4-liter "2AZ-FE" powerplant replaced by the 2.5-liter "2AR-FE" engine and with it bringing new six-speed manual and automatic transmissions.
The car can run in an all-electric mode, gasoline-only or both.
In some markets, the top-level powertrain combination was a 3.5-liter "2GR-FE" V6 engine paired exclusively to a six-speed automatic.
A real-time dashboard screen shows power distribution and the operation of the hybrid system and the tachometer is replaced by an analog fuel economy readout.
Toyota also offered a hybrid electric version of the 2.4-liter engine, designated "2AZ-FXE" that employs the Atkinson cycle to maximize fuel economy.
The hybrid drivetrain has also necessitated a redesigned front subframe, along with remodeled rear and center floor pressings.
The hybrid utilizes Toyota's Hybrid Synergy Drive (HSD) system and makes use of Toyota's electronic continuously variable transmission (e-CVT)—a mechanism similar in function to a regular CVT.
This was required to accommodate the battery pack, which is stowed in the trunk.
The gasoline engine produces and of torque, with the 650-volt electric motor providing and .
Other differences include wheel spats and underbody pans which reduce aerodynamic drag from 0.28 to 0.27 "c", an "Eco" operating mode for the HVAC system that reduces the output of air conditioning to assist fuel economy, and Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM).
Working in conjunction, both powerplants produce a total combined output of , however, due to the intricacy of quantifying a combined torque figure, Toyota has not provided one.
Cosmetic changes are limited to redesigned tail lights with LEDs, a chrome-lined grille, as opposed to the color-coded version on every other Camry trim, and hybrid-oriented emblems including "Hybrid" badging on the front fenders and a decklid-mounted "Hybrid Synergy Drive" logo.
The battery pack utilized by the hybrid version is a trunk-mounted nickel-metal hydride unit, weighing in at about .
For the facelifted version that debuted at the January 2009 North American International Auto Show, Toyota worked to better differentiate the styling of the hybrid away from the rest of the Camry range.
Approximately of hybrid hardware is fitted to the car in total.
This was achieved by fitting a distinct front fascia with a large, central air dam, vertically slotted fog lamps, and a single-blade grille.
However, Toyota claims this is negated by the increased output courtesy of the electric motor that improves acceleration by an estimated 15 percent over the non-hybrid 2.4-liter, five-speed automatic variant.
From the rear, the tail lamps abstain from the primarily red lens inserts fitted previously, to predominantly clear lenses, while the interior receives a newly designed fuel economy gauge.
At the November 2008 LA Auto Show, Toyota unveiled a concept compressed natural gas (CNG)-powered hybrid electric version.
The design registrations for the facelifted Camry Hybrid, noting changes made to the original were filed on 19 December 2008 at the US Patent and Trademark Office.
Toyota improved the Camry's safety by increasing the XV40's structural rigidity.
Powertrain options for the Camry XV40 comprised both four- and six-cylinder engines with manual and automatic transmissions.
This has been achieved through the application of ultra high-tensile steel, which is hot stamped to the Camry's roof, A- and B-pillars, and rocker panels.
The entry-level engine was a 2.4-liter "2AZ-FE" four-cylinder in front-wheel drive configuration available with manual and automatic transmissions, both five-speed units.
The structure of the front seat mounts were designed to transfer side collision impact loads across the car.
For the Japanese market only, an all-wheel drive variant of the 2.4-liter engine was available, although a four-speed automatic was the sole transmission fitted.
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) awarded the Camry sedan an overall rating of "good" in both frontal offset and side impact crash tests.
All other XV40 series Camrys utilize front-wheel drive.
Both tests also receive the "good" rating in all 14 measured categories, and is also rated "good" in the roof strength test with a 5.31 strength-to-weight ratio withstanding a peak force of .
XV40s produced in the United States from January 2009 saw the 2.4-liter "2AZ-FE" powerplant replaced by the 2.5-liter "2AR-FE" engine and with it bringing new six-speed manual and automatic transmissions.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) originally rated the XV40 the full five-star rating for the frontal driver, frontal passenger, side driver, and side rear passenger tests, and a four-star rating for the rollover test.
In some markets, the top-level powertrain combination was a 3.5-liter "2GR-FE" V6 engine paired exclusively to a six-speed automatic.
However, under the new NHTSA testing methodology introduced in 2010, the 2011 model year XV40 was downgraded to a three-star rating.
Toyota also offered a hybrid electric version of the 2.4-liter engine, designated "2AZ-FXE" that employs the Atkinson cycle to maximize fuel economy.
This overall vehicle score was broken down into the frontal barrier crash rating of four-stars for the driver (male), and two-stars for the front passenger (female), giving an overall front-impact protection rating of three-stars.
The hybrid utilizes Toyota's Hybrid Synergy Drive (HSD) system and makes use of Toyota's electronic continuously variable transmission (e-CVT)—a mechanism similar in function to a regular CVT.

This resulted in an increase to the side barrier rating from two- to four-stars for the front female passenger, thus increasing the Camry's overall score to four-stars.
Approximately of hybrid hardware is fitted to the car in total.
Testing conducted by the Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) resulted in the Camry XV40 receiving a four-star safety rating or a score of 27.53 out of 37.
However, Toyota claims this is negated by the increased output courtesy of the electric motor that improves acceleration by an estimated 15 percent over the non-hybrid 2.4-liter, five-speed automatic variant.
Dual frontal airbags were fitted to the model tested.
At the November 2008 LA Auto Show, Toyota unveiled a concept compressed natural gas (CNG)-powered hybrid electric version.
ANCAP later tested the hybrid variant fitted with additional side and curtain airbags.
Toyota improved the Camry's safety by increasing the XV40's structural rigidity.
The hybrid also scored four-stars, although did achieve a higher 28.22-point grading.
This has been achieved through the application of ultra high-tensile steel, which is hot stamped to the Camry's roof, A- and B-pillars, and rocker panels.
Prompted by the five-star ANCAP safety rating mandate for all passenger cars purchased by the Australian federal government from 1 July 2011, Toyota Australia revised the XV40 specification including the fitment of a front passenger seatbelt reminder.
The structure of the front seat mounts were designed to transfer side collision impact loads across the car.
This resulted in an upgraded five-star result for Australian models produced from May 2011.
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) awarded the Camry sedan an overall rating of "good" in both frontal offset and side impact crash tests.
While the regular version scored 33.13 points, the hybrid rated marginally better at 33.22 out of 37.

On 26 September 2007, Toyota recalled the optional "all-weather" heavy-duty rubber floor mats from 2007 and 2008 model year Toyota Camry XV40s sold in North America.
Subsequently, the NHTSA tested a later release of the 2011 model year Camry with enhanced safety.
Toyota issued a second recall on 2 November 2009 asking owners to remove the driver floor mat and not replace it with any other type of mat.
This resulted in an increase to the side barrier rating from two- to four-stars for the front female passenger, thus increasing the Camry's overall score to four-stars.
Toyota extended its floor mat recall on 25 November to reconfigure the accelerator pedal, replace the all-weather floor mats, and install a brake override system to prevent sudden unintended acceleration.
Testing conducted by the Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) resulted in the Camry XV40 receiving a four-star safety rating or a score of 27.53 out of 37.
Toyota issued a fourth unwanted acceleration-related recall for the Camry on 21 January 2010, this time in response to reports of accelerator pedals sticking in models without floor mats.
Dual frontal airbags were fitted to the model tested.
Evaluations by "Car and Driver" and Edmunds found that the Camry's brakes were powerful enough to overcome the accelerator in all tests, bringing the car safely to a stop.
ANCAP later tested the hybrid variant fitted with additional side and curtain airbags.
Toyota Camry XV40s were produced at the Tsutsumi Plant in Toyota, Aichi, Japan; the Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky production site at Georgetown, Kentucky in the United States; Toyota Australia's facility in Altona, Victoria; and Shushary, Saint Petersburg, Russia from December 2007.

After Mexico 55 and Chicago 59, Manoel not arrive until São Paulo 63.
In a 20-meter pool, under the guidance of Bruno Buch, his first master, he began to train, compete and make the team gym.
At the 1959 Pan American Games, in Chicago, he finished 4th in the 100-metre freestyle.
The strongest swimmer of the group was a boy three years older than Manoel, named João Gonçalves Filho, future champion and South American record holder in the backstroke and an athlete in various sports, who participated in various Olympic Games.
In February 1960, Santos went to the South American Championship in Cali, Colombia.
In 1955, Manoel dos Santos approached the national top.
But Manoel dos Santos fulfilled its role fairly, taking the gold in the 100m freestyle and leading the Brazilian relays to win two golds and a silver.
He swam backstroke, and his training was more focused in this style.
In the end, Brazil won the first championship in history.
In the 100-meter freestyle, Brazil was in a time of transition in national leadership.
In 1960, Manoel dos Santos was swimmer of the Pinheiros.
The top three sprinters in the country at the turn of the decade and early '50s (Aram Boghossian, Sérgio Rodrigues and Plauto Guimarães) had retired.
But he continued to follow the guidelines determined by your Hirano technician, from Santos.
Paulo Catunda and Haroldo Lara were the fastest at this time.
He used the Pinheiros pool, and sometimes the Corinthians pool, during the summer and in the winter, down the hill and gave their strokes in the Clube de Regatas Internacional.
Lara was the best swimmer in the country until 1957, when he retired, moved to Italy and became an opera singer.
In July 60, during the pre-Olympic final preparations, in Rio de Janeiro, Manoel convincingly broke his South American record of the 100-metre freestyle, with a time of 55.6.
In March 1955, at age 16, Manoel was summoned to his first international competition, the II Pan American Games in Mexico City.
This achievement has positioned him as a strong competitor to the Olympic medal in Rome.
At this time, athletes were still amateurs.
Manuel, who started to swim for health problems, was the first Brazilian to get an Olympic medal in the sport in the 1960 Games.
In Mexico, after a trip into a military aircraft, a DC-3, which lasted four days, with overnight in Belém, Trinidad and Tobago and Cuba, Manoel competed very poorly.
In August, the Brazilian swimming team left for Europe.
His main memory of the tournament was the moment he left desolate of proof, fell on a nearby heating pool and pretending to be loosening up, cried a lot, solitude, until the last tear is lost hidden in the middle of chlorine.
Or rather, with political sense, determined by the military leadership in the Brazilian Olympic sports, typical of those times.
At the 1955 Pan American Games in Mexico City, he finished 4th in the 4 × 100-metre medley.
In Lisbon, a pool with water at 13 degrees temperature, Brazilian swimmers competed against a much weaker team than theirs, the selection of Portugal.
The following year, on February 56, in Viña del Mar, Chile, was the thirteenth edition of the South American Swimming Championships.
The result was a tonsillitis in the biggest star of Brazil, the only Brazilian swimmer until then to go to Olympics with real chances of escaping anonymity.
At the previous twelve, Brazil defeated Argentina only once, in the same Viña del Mar, in 1941.
Manoel followed Lisbon, under antibiotic effect, landed and went to the Olympic village to soak for another day, away from the pool.
Manoel dos Santos ranked fifth in the final of the 100-metre freestyle, and Haroldo Lara took the fourth position.
Then would be three more days to recover before the qualifiers of the 100-metre freestyle, the traditional opening race of the Olympic program at that time.
In the 200-metre backstroke, Manoel was fourth and the race was won by his compatriot João Gonçalves.
In Rome, the aquatic stadium was impressive, but the tables used to massage were still the traditional table tennis tables.
In the 4x100-metre freestyle relay, the competition had a spectacular end.
On Friday, August 29, 1960, at 8:30 am, began the swimming with the heats of the men's 100-metre free.
Peru team was the gold medalist, with a time of 3:59.7, a championship record.
Manoel dos Santos, swimming in lane 4, won the third series, with a time of 56.3.
A tenth of a second ago, silver medalist, arrived Brazil.
Twenty-four swimmers passed into the semis.
The Argentines came in third, nine-tenths of a second behind Brazil.
At night, in the semis, Manoel again won, tied in the same third grade in the same lane 4, with the same time 56.3.
The Brazilian relay team had Haroldo Lara, Manuel dos Santos, João Gonçalves and Aristarco de Oliveira.
Overall, now, he ranked fourth draw.
In partial takes, Manoel was the fastest of the four.
To qualify for the final was necessary 56.5, the Canadian Richard Pound's time, who, many years later, was to become famous as the sheriff of WADA, the world anti-doping agency.
He stated that, at that moment, he realized that his specialty and future were the 100-metre freestyle, and the backstroke was just a byproduct.
Manoel dos Santos was cast in the lap 6.
This flare, this awareness of where his true talent lay resulted in a short time, a leap of improvement.
He knew that would only have a chance if swam a second faster than the day before.
As for the South American, as expected, porteños took the title again.
Was given the starting gun, the plateau output of those days, and were almost 40 meters without breathing.
In November 1956, at the new pool of CR Vasco da Gama, Manoel dos Santos failed to get Olympic qualification, by two tenths of a second.
When common sense screamed and he turned to right for the first pull of air, Manoel saw no one.
In 1957, finishing the secondary school in Rio Claro, Manoel dos Santos moved to Santos, São Paulo.
A few more strokes until Manoel locate the position of the opponents.
The choice of the new city was due to Minoru Hirano, his new coach, teacher, and almost a father.
Meanwhile, much has happened on his head, including the ability to have escaped, size fright that he took.
Hirano entered to swimming by the paths of the translation service, carried out during the stay of the "Flying Fish" in Brazil in 1950.
In the crucial seconds of preparation for the turn, turn this more complicated in 1960, due to the requirement of hand touch before somersault and nonexistent glasses, Manuel was somewhat lost and was only find when hit unexpectedly, your forearm on the edge of the pool.
Hirano got much swimming knowledge, monitoring and deciphering the Japanese Olympians and world record holders.
Who was there saw Manoel hit right in front in the 50-meter, turn of bumbling way, and came back behind the other competitors.
In the late 50s, the footage of the training, even in Brazil, began to increase substantially.
In the line of 80 meters, Manoel had regained the lead.
Hirano was against the current.
And there it came time to pay the price of unpredictable.
He did Manoel swim a thousand meters and then working leg, positioning stroke, angle etc. chin, and finished with a half dozen shots of 25m.
Although he maintained that died in the 20 meters remaining, the final difference was two tenths of a second.
Often he could not attend the training, and Manoel came alone to the session with a little paper in hand, or the sequence decorated into his head.
The gold involved one of the most troubled decisions in the history of Olympic swimming.
In December 1957, Manoel broke the Brazilian record of Haroldo Lara, and the South American record of Argentine Pedro Galvao in Santos, on 25 meter pool (still valid in that year), with a time of 56.5.
Back in Brazil, Manoel entered the typical period of post-Olympics relaxation.
Further, in February 1958, was held the South American Championships in Montevideo.
Lost some shape.
For the first time in the history of the tournament, the winner of the 100-metre freestyle won the race handily, not in the beat of hand, but two and a half seconds ahead of, or fifteen feet away - Manoel dos Santos.
The warning came in an unexpected defeat in Brazil.
The only Brazilian besides Armando Freitas in 1939, to win the gold.
In unlucky pool of Vasco da Gama, the Brazilian Championship, in early 1961, Manoel took silver in the 100-metre freestyle, with a time of 57.8.
The silver medal went to nearly invincible Ismael Martínez Merino, Peruvian three times champion in 52, 54 and 56.
The training again intensify.
The Manoel's time in qualifying, 56.6, represented new South American record, as from 1958, all international federations officiated the rule of consider valid only records obtained in 50 meter pool.
Manoel was invited to attend a series of international competitions of high level, first in Japan, then accidentally in the United States.
The following year, came the first trip to the United States.
Those years were the last in which Japan's reputation in swimming even annually brought the most talented international guests, especially Americans, to participate in the Japanese national championship and other display competitions during the Japanese summer.
The beds in the Olympic village assembled at the University of Chicago, were those of American soft mattress, strange and uncomfortable for someone who grew up sleeping on a hard bed of boarding school.
This tradition came from the 30s, when Japanese and Americans completely dominated the swimming scene.
The body aching, and barely slept, and back that do not reared more, affected the balance of swimming.
After a bureaucratic and political exercise with the Brazilian sports directors, which would have its price charged in due time, Manoel went to Japan bringing Hirano.
Manoel dos Santos, the great hope of the Brazilian Swimming to win a medal at the Pan American Games in 1959, got only a fourth place in the 100-metre freestyle, swimming above the 58s, when expectations revolved around the 56s.
There, he and the Argentine Luis Nicolao, the other guest, joined the American team representing the World "cream of the cream", and left for a tour of three competitions in the Nipponese islands.
The Manoel's curriculum, regarding Pans, was forever beyond the means of his talent.
As often happens with Brazilian and Hispanic abroad, one saw the other the illusion of being bilingual, when in fact the communication occurs through a third "language", a dragged portunhol.
After Mexico 55 and Chicago 59, Manoel not arrive until São Paulo 63.
But what no one knew was that there, between the two young Latinos, a little lost in the east and in the shadow of the American and Japanese famous swimmers, was kept hidden half of world speed records in swimming, soon to be revealed to the whole world inside the pool of Guanabara.
At the 1959 Pan American Games, in Chicago, he finished 4th in the 100-metre freestyle.
In Tokyo, at the Japanese Championship, he took first in the qualifiers, semis and final, with the times of 55.1, 55.2 and 55.3, respectively.
He also swam the 4 × 100-metre medley.
The 55.1 represented a new South American record.
In February 1960, Santos went to the South American Championship in Cali, Colombia.
In those days, the approval of records took weeks, and often, they were broken before formalized.
In the altitude, his times were not very good.
It happened in Japan because Manoel also took gold in competitions in Nagoya and Osaka, and in the latter he lowered the South American record another tenth, driven to 55.
But Manoel dos Santos fulfilled its role fairly, taking the gold in the 100m freestyle and leading the Brazilian relays to win two golds and a silver.
The trip to Japan has Manoel well recognized among American swimmers and technical and specialized sports press.
The battle against the Argentines was very fierce, both the female and the male.
Indeed, some people have come to provide a world record if Manoel improve his only weakness, the complicated Olympic turn of those times.
In the end, Brazil won the first championship in history.
Returning from Japan, by Los Angeles route, Manoel decided to go to Hawaii.
In 1960, Manoel dos Santos was swimmer of the Pinheiros.
Several days later, Manuel, tanned, relaxed and untrained, landed in Los Angeles.
But he continued to follow the guidelines determined by your Hirano technician, from Santos.
Given his recent fame acquired then, he was invited to participate in the American championship in that city and accepted.
He used the Pinheiros pool, and sometimes the Corinthians pool, during the summer and in the winter, down the hill and gave their strokes in the Clube de Regatas Internacional.
On August 18, 1961, Steve Clark, successively defeated by Manoel in Japan, won the final of the 100-metre freestyle, in the bustling crowd.
In July 60, during the pre-Olympic final preparations, in Rio de Janeiro, Manoel convincingly broke his South American record of the 100-metre freestyle, with a time of 55.6.
His 54.4 time beat the previous world record of 54.6, from Australian John Devitt, since January 1957.
This achievement has positioned him as a strong competitor to the Olympic medal in Rome.
Manoel was not at all bad, but ranked fourth, swimming over 55s.
Manuel, who started to swim for health problems, was the first Brazilian to get an Olympic medal in the sport in the 1960 Games.
Even in the pool, he was photographed shaking Clark, and appeared in the edition of the Swimming World Magazine September 1961.
In August, the Brazilian swimming team left for Europe.
Manoel categorically stated that on returning to Brazil he would beat that world record.
First, a meaningless stop in Portugal, to the Luso-Brazilian Games.
Clark listened and did not dare to doubt, as would reveal in the future.
Or rather, with political sense, determined by the military leadership in the Brazilian Olympic sports, typical of those times.
The Brazilian was for some time too near the top of the world, not to believe that this would be possible.
Major Padilha was the "eternal" head of the Brazilian delegation.
On September 21, 1961, in Rio de Janeiro, alone in the swimming pool of Club de Regatas Guanabara, dos Santos set a new world record for the 100-metre freestyle with a time of 53.6 seconds.
In Lisbon, a pool with water at 13 degrees temperature, Brazilian swimmers competed against a much weaker team than theirs, the selection of Portugal.
The Company was formed in 1903, out of the merger of "George Trollope & Sons" (founded by Joseph Trollope, a wallpaper hanger, in 1778) and "Colls & Sons" (founded by Benjamin Colls, a painter and decorator, in 1840).
The result was a tonsillitis in the biggest star of Brazil, the only Brazilian swimmer until then to go to Olympics with real chances of escaping anonymity.
The merged firm started to specialise in civil engineering and during World War I undertook pioneering work on reinforced concrete.
Manoel followed Lisbon, under antibiotic effect, landed and went to the Olympic village to soak for another day, away from the pool.
In 1969 the Company was acquired by Trafalgar House.
Then would be three more days to recover before the qualifiers of the 100-metre freestyle, the traditional opening race of the Olympic program at that time.
On 18 April 1996 Norwegian shipbuilding and engineering group Kvaerner acquired "Trafalgar House Construction", as the business became known, as part of a £904 million offer for Trafalgar House plc.
In Rome, the aquatic stadium was impressive, but the tables used to massage were still the traditional table tennis tables.
Projects undertaken by the Company included: the Institute of Chartered Accountants completed in 1892, Claridges completed in 1897, the Baltic Exchange completed in 1903, Lloyds Bank in Lombard Street completed in 1931, Trawsfynndd power station completed in 1962 and the Stock Exchange Tower completed in 1972.
On Friday, August 29, 1960, at 8:30 am, began the swimming with the heats of the men's 100-metre free.
He was born in either 1861 or 1863 in Chicago, Illinois.
Manoel dos Santos, swimming in lane 4, won the third series, with a time of 56.3.
Attending the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Symons also studied in Europe and won awards at the National Academy of Design and the Corcoran Gallery of Art.
It was the third tied best time overall.
Symons was one of the plein-air painters who built their studios in Laguna Beach, California during the early 1900s.
Twenty-four swimmers passed into the semis.
He died in Hillside, New Jersey in 1930.
To qualify had to do 58.2.
Patrick Sharp (died 1615) was a Scottish theologian and Principal of the University of Glasgow.
At night, in the semis, Manoel again won, tied in the same third grade in the same lane 4, with the same time 56.3.
Soon after 1575 he was appointed one of a commission of classical scholars to draw up a new Latin grammar for use in the Scottish schools.
Overall, now, he ranked fourth draw.
In 1585 James VI appointed him Principal of the University of Glasgow.
The first three positions were for American Lance Larson and Bruce Hunter, and the Australian John Devitt, with the times of 55.5, 55.7 and 55.8, respectively.
From this time he took an important part in the government and controversies of the Scottish church, He seems to have wished to preserve a position of neutrality between the two parties which divided the kirk, but he gradually inclined to the king's party.
To qualify for the final was necessary 56.5, the Canadian Richard Pound's time, who, many years later, was to become famous as the sheriff of WADA, the world anti-doping agency.
In 1586 he was placed on a commission charged by the general assembly to control the proceedings of the bishops.
The next day, Saturday, at 9:10 in the evening, it was time for the final.
In 1596 the general assembly appointed him and fifteen others to organise the church in opposition to the government.
Manoel dos Santos was cast in the lap 6.
Consequently, he was ordered by the privy council to return to Glasgow.
He knew that would only have a chance if swam a second faster than the day before.
But in the same year he took part in the reactionary general assembly at Perth, and in 1597 he formed part of the commission to whom were delegated the powers of the general assembly when that body was not in session, and whose appointment paved the way for the re-establishment of episcopacy.
Was given the starting gun, the plateau output of those days, and were almost 40 meters without breathing.
In 1606 Sharp was summoned to Hampton Court with seven other divines, to support the king's side in a debate with Andrew Melville and seven strong presbyterians, on the general questions at issue between king and kirk.
Proof of his life.
In the same year he was appointed constant moderator to the Glasgow presbytery in the absence of the bishop, and encountered such opposition that the privy council ordered the presbytery to receive him under pain of rebellion.
When common sense screamed and he turned to right for the first pull of air, Manoel saw no one.
The following year he was rebuked for endeavoring to extend the judicial powers of the presbytery to the decision of criminal cases.
Hunter in lane 5, Larson in 4, and Devitt in 3, were out of the fast first look radar.
In 1609 Sharp took part in the Falkland conference, which was intended to make matters easy for the bishops at the general assembly.
Certainly were not in front.
On 15 May 1610 he was appointed to the Scottish court of high commission, and held the office till 11 August 1614.
They could be behind, and it was no small difference.
He died in May 1615, having been twice married: first, to Mary Fowlls, widow of John Houlden of Balwill, on 1 September 1593, by whom he had two sons, David and Christian, and two daughters; and, secondly, to Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Gale of Eastwood, by whom he had a son James.
It was bewildering.
Only one of his works survives, "Doctrinae Christianae brevis explicatio", printed by Robert Waldegrave in Edinburgh in 1599.
A few more strokes until Manoel locate the position of the opponents.
Igor Vladimirovich Mukhin (born 19 November 1961), also known as Igor Vladimirovich Moukhin, is a Russian photographer.
Meanwhile, much has happened on his head, including the ability to have escaped, size fright that he took.
After graduating from college, Mukhin worked in a project institute.
In the crucial seconds of preparation for the turn, turn this more complicated in 1960, due to the requirement of hand touch before somersault and nonexistent glasses, Manuel was somewhat lost and was only find when hit unexpectedly, your forearm on the edge of the pool.
From 1985 to 1986 he attended classes at the studio of prominent Moscow photographer Alexander Lapin.
Who was there saw Manoel hit right in front in the 50-meter, turn of bumbling way, and came back behind the other competitors.
He later spent several years working with samizdat rock musicians.
All that was left to him speed up all he had, again.
Since 1989 he has been working as an independent photographer.
In the line of 80 meters, Manoel had regained the lead.
Mukhin is known for his photographs of Soviet rock musicians of the perestroika period, including Viktor Tsoi, Boris Grebenshchikov, and Petr Mamonov.
And there it came time to pay the price of unpredictable.
His projects have included "The Soviet Monuments", "The Soviet Bench", "Fragments of Evident Propaganda", "The Soviet Children's Playgrounds", "Night Moscow", "Girls", "Moscow in Winter: Heavy Breath of Winter" and "The Province.
Although he maintained that died in the 20 meters remaining, the final difference was two tenths of a second.
Some of the photographs from these projects were shown at the Tretyakov gallery and La Maison Rouge in Paris in 2007.
The gold involved one of the most troubled decisions in the history of Olympic swimming.
In the mid-1990s, Mukhin worked on documentary projects about Moscow and provincial Russia.
But Manuel was not in controversy, as his bronze had been clear at the time of 55.4, new South American record.
In 1999, Mukhin received a grant from the Paris Mayor's office to work on a project titled "Lovers in Paris" sponsored by FNAC (Fonds national d'art contemporain) and the French Committee to commemorate the year 2000.
Back in Brazil, Manoel entered the typical period of post-Olympics relaxation.
Mukhin usually uses rangefinder cameras including the Leica M6 and black and white film.
Lost some shape.
His work has been published in many Russian magazines and in foreign editions such as "Rolling Stone", "GEO", "Elle", "Vogue", "Le Monde", "Libération", "Esquire", and "Time" among others.
But in his case, and in that time, talent was worth more than a long cycle training base.
Alto de Santana ("Santana Heights") is a name commonly used, especially by business, to refer to an upper middle class area of Santana district in São Paulo city, Brazil.
Back to the pool, recovery was rapid.
The term is used informally to refer to the bairro of Vila Santana "(Santana Village)" and the elevated region of the Santana bairro.
The warning came in an unexpected defeat in Brazil.
Among the major routes that pass through the region are: "Voluntários da Pátria street, Francisca Júlia street, Pedro Doll street, Doutor Guilherme Cristoffel street and Doutor Luis Lustosa da Silva street".
In unlucky pool of Vasco da Gama, the Brazilian Championship, in early 1961, Manoel took silver in the 100-metre freestyle, with a time of 57.8.
In Alto de Santana is located the Baruel Mansion, an old castle founded in the 19th century.
The winner, a full second in front, was the great swimmer from Paulistano, Athos de Oliveira, who, besides being a good freestyle swimmer, it was the best Brazilian backstroker in the first half of the 60s.
The region is classified by CRECI (Federal Council of Real Estate) as Value of Zone B like other upper middle class areas of the capital: Brooklin, Cerqueira César e Paraíso.
The training again intensify.
It is found in the Pacific Northwest of North America.
The motivation was the same as today is part of the routine of the best swimmers, but at that time was a rarity.
In Alberta it has been collected only in the extreme southeastern corner.
Manoel was invited to attend a series of international competitions of high level, first in Japan, then accidentally in the United States.
Reported food plants include "Artemisia tridentata".
Those years were the last in which Japan's reputation in swimming even annually brought the most talented international guests, especially Americans, to participate in the Japanese national championship and other display competitions during the Japanese summer.
The term Afroasiatic "Urheimat" refers to the hypothetical place where speakers of the proto-Afroasiatic language lived in a single linguistic community, or complex of communities, before this original language dispersed geographically and divided into separate distinct languages.
This tradition came from the 30s, when Japanese and Americans completely dominated the swimming scene.
This speech area is known as the "Urheimat" ("original homeland" in German).
After a bureaucratic and political exercise with the Brazilian sports directors, which would have its price charged in due time, Manoel went to Japan bringing Hirano.
Afroasiatic languages are today distributed in parts of Africa and Western Asia.
There, he and the Argentine Luis Nicolao, the other guest, joined the American team representing the World "cream of the cream", and left for a tour of three competitions in the Nipponese islands.
The contemporary Afroasiatic languages are spoken in the Near East, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, and parts of the Sahara/Sahel.
Nicolao and Manoel, by geographic solidarity, but also for survival pragmatism, were close companions during that stay.
The various hypotheses for the Afroasiatic "Urheimat" are distributed throughout this territory; that is, it is generally assumed that proto-Afroasiatic was spoken in some region where Afroasiatic languages are still spoken today.
As often happens with Brazilian and Hispanic abroad, one saw the other the illusion of being bilingual, when in fact the communication occurs through a third "language", a dragged portunhol.
However, there is argument as to which part of the contemporary Afroasiatic speech area corresponds with the original homeland.
But what no one knew was that there, between the two young Latinos, a little lost in the east and in the shadow of the American and Japanese famous swimmers, was kept hidden half of world speed records in swimming, soon to be revealed to the whole world inside the pool of Guanabara.
The earliest written evidence of an Afroasiatic language is an Ancient Egyptian inscription dated c. 3400 BC (5,400 years ago).
Manoel did a great job.
Symbols on Gerzean pottery resembling Egyptian hieroglyphs date back to c. 4000 BC, suggesting a still earlier possible date.
In Tokyo, at the Japanese Championship, he took first in the qualifiers, semis and final, with the times of 55.1, 55.2 and 55.3, respectively.
This gives us a minimum date for the age of Afroasiatic.
The best American sprinter, Steve Clark, and Japanese, Yamanaka, were behind.
However, Ancient Egyptian is highly divergent from proto-Afroasiatic (Trombetti 1905: 1–2), and considerable time must have elapsed in between them.
The 55.1 represented a new South American record.
Estimates of the date at which the proto-Afroasiatic language was spoken vary widely.
In those days, the approval of records took weeks, and often, they were broken before formalized.
They fall within a range between approximately 7,500 BC (9,500 years ago) and approximately 16,000 BC (18,000 years ago).
It happened in Japan because Manoel also took gold in competitions in Nagoya and Osaka, and in the latter he lowered the South American record another tenth, driven to 55.
According to Igor M. Diakonoff (1988: 33n), proto-Afroasiatic was spoken c. 10,000 BC.
, the best mark in history until then in international competitions.
According to Christopher Ehret (2002: 35–36), proto-Afroasiatic was spoken c. 11,000 BC at the latest, and possibly as early as c. 16,000 BC.
The trip to Japan has Manoel well recognized among American swimmers and technical and specialized sports press.
These dates are older than dates associated with most other protolanguages.
It was the realization that the fury of the first 50 meters in the Rome Olympics was not accidental.
Culturally this falls within the period of the Halfan culture which may have been proto-Afroasiatic.
Indeed, some people have come to provide a world record if Manoel improve his only weakness, the complicated Olympic turn of those times.
Supporters of a non-North or Northeast African origin for Afroasiatic are particularly common among those with a background in Semitic or Egyptological studies, or amongst archaeological proponents of the "farming/language dispersal hypothesis" according to which major language groups dispersed with early farming technology in the Neolithic.
Returning from Japan, by Los Angeles route, Manoel decided to go to Hawaii.
The leading linguistic proponent of this idea in recent times is Alexander Militarev.
Several days later, Manuel, tanned, relaxed and untrained, landed in Los Angeles.
Arguments for and against this position depend upon the contested proposal that farming-related words can be reconstructed in Proto-Afroasiatic, with farming technology being widely thought to have spread from the Levant into North Africa and then the Horn of Africa.
Given his recent fame acquired then, he was invited to participate in the American championship in that city and accepted.
Militarev, who linked proto-Afroasiatic to the Levantine Natufian culture, that preceded the spread of farming technology, believes the language family to be about 10,000 years old.
On August 18, 1961, Steve Clark, successively defeated by Manoel in Japan, won the final of the 100-metre freestyle, in the bustling crowd.
He wrote (Militarev 2002, p. 135) that the "Proto-Afrasian language, on the verge of a split into daughter languages", meaning, in his scenario, into "Cushitic, Omotic, Egyptian, Semitic and Chadic-Berber", "should be roughly dated to the ninth millennium BC".
His 54.4 time beat the previous world record of 54.6, from Australian John Devitt, since January 1957.
But an Asiatic origin need not be associated exclusively with the migration of agricultural populations: according to linguists, words for dog (an Asian domesticate) reconstruct to Proto-Afroasiatic as well as words for bow and arrow, which according to archaeologists spread rapidly across North Africa once they were introduced from the Near East i.e. Ounan points.
Manoel was not at all bad, but ranked fourth, swimming over 55s.
A scenario that also fits the linguistic evidence is one in which Afroasiatic languages were introduced into Africa together with advanced hunting techniques before the subsequent introduction of agriculture.
Even in the pool, he was photographed shaking Clark, and appeared in the edition of the Swimming World Magazine September 1961.
The Horn of Africa, particularly the area of Ethiopia and Eritrea, has been proposed by some linguists as the origin of the language group because it includes the majority of the diversity of the Afroasiatic language family and has very diverse groups in close geographic proximity, sometimes considered a telltale sign for a linguistic geographic origin.
Only between the two, there was a promise, or "friend threat."
Although at Lake Turkana microlithic arrowheads appear in southern Africa (71,000 BP) and with the Aterian culture (30,000 BP) suggests that arrowheads "may" have been an invention originating in Africa taken into the Near East by a pre-Afroasiatic late glacial migration.
Manoel categorically stated that on returning to Brazil he would beat that world record.
At the site of Nataruk in Turkana County, Kenya, obsidian bladelets found embedded in a skull and within the thoracic cavity of another skeleton, may suggest the use of stone-tipped arrows as weapons.
Clark listened and did not dare to doubt, as would reveal in the future.
After the end of the last glacial period, use of the bow seems to have spread to every inhabited continent, including the New World, except for Australia.
The Brazilian was for some time too near the top of the world, not to believe that this would be possible.
However, these finds predate by far any proposed date for the evolution of Afroasiatic.
On September 21, 1961, in Rio de Janeiro, alone in the swimming pool of Club de Regatas Guanabara, dos Santos set a new world record for the 100-metre freestyle with a time of 53.6 seconds.
In the next phase, unlike many other authors Ehret proposed an initial split between northern, southern and Omotic.
Manuel was also the South American champion for eleven years between 1958 and 1969.
The northern group includes Semitic, Egyptian and Berber (agreeing with others such as Diakonoff).
Trollope & Colls was once one of the United Kingdom's largest construction companies.
He proposed that Chadic stems from Berber (some other authors group it with southern Afroasiatic languages such as Cushitic ones).
The Company was formed in 1903, out of the merger of "George Trollope & Sons" (founded by Joseph Trollope, a wallpaper hanger, in 1778) and "Colls & Sons" (founded by Benjamin Colls, a painter and decorator, in 1840).
Another proposal is that Semitic is an offshoot of a northern family of Afroasiatic languages, including Berber, and possibly Egyptian.
The merged firm started to specialise in civil engineering and during World War I undertook pioneering work on reinforced concrete.
It then entered the Levant and was possibly spread by what Juris Zarins calls the Syro-Arabian nomadic pastoralism complex, spreading south along the shores of the Red Sea and northeast around the edge of the "Fertile Crescent".
In 1969 the Company was acquired by Trafalgar House.
It is thought that Semitic speakers then crossed from South Arabia back into Eritrea.
By 1994 it was the largest contractor in the United Kingdom by turnover.
In contrast, Bender proposed on linguistic grounds that Cushitic (found in the Horn of Africa) shares important innovations with Semitic and Berber, and that these three split off early from the others, while still near an original homeland of all Afroasiatic.
On 18 April 1996 Norwegian shipbuilding and engineering group Kvaerner acquired "Trafalgar House Construction", as the business became known, as part of a £904 million offer for Trafalgar House plc.
Igor Diakonoff proposed the Eastern Sahara region, specifically the southern fringe of the Sahara.
Projects undertaken by the Company included: the Institute of Chartered Accountants completed in 1892, Claridges completed in 1897, the Baltic Exchange completed in 1903, Lloyds Bank in Lombard Street completed in 1931, Trawsfynndd power station completed in 1962 and the Stock Exchange Tower completed in 1972.
Lionel Bender proposed the area near Khartoum, Sudan, at the confluence of the Blue Nile and White Nile.
George Gardner Symons (1861-1930) was an American impressionist painter.
The details of his theory are widely cited but controversial, as it involves the proposal that Semitic originated in Ethiopia and crossed to Asia directly from there over the Red Sea.
He was born in either 1861 or 1863 in Chicago, Illinois.
This could also potentially solidify Bender's argument, in that scholars today believe that there is a relationship between the Cushitic branch and the Chadic Branch; arguing that perhaps Chadic descends from Cushitic.
Attending the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Symons also studied in Europe and won awards at the National Academy of Design and the Corcoran Gallery of Art.
Prior to Colonialism the Hausa peoples of present-day Niger, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, and Chad were not united as a single polity, but rather they existed as a sequence of seven city-states (situated between the Niger River and Lake Chad); each with their own Sovereign dynasty named after their shared common progenitor known as Bayajidda, who apparently came from the "East" to which a great deal of scholars attribute to being the "Middle East', though this is contested.
Symons was one of the plein-air painters who built their studios in Laguna Beach, California during the early 1900s.
Each City-State were their own entities but were intertwined through trade, language, religion, customs, and ethnic identity/relations; hence comprising a sizable cultural stock that had greater trade links with larger states and empires such as the Ghana Empire, Mali Empire, Kanem-Bornu Empires, etc.
He died in Hillside, New Jersey in 1930.
In current day southwestern Chad and northeastern Cameroon in the Lake Chad Basin, there are several ethnic groups that also speak an Afroasiatic language similar to the Hausas.
Patrick Sharp (died 1615) was a Scottish theologian and Principal of the University of Glasgow.
They are known as respectively: the Biu–Mandara, Tumak, Nancere, Kera, Dangaléat, Mukulu, Sokoro, etc.
He was made master of Glasgow grammar school in 1574.
Together with the Hausa, they collectively comprise the Chadic branch of the Afro-Asiatic family.
Soon after 1575 he was appointed one of a commission of classical scholars to draw up a new Latin grammar for use in the Scottish schools.
There are also remnants of a civilization on the Cameroon side of Lake Chad that date back to at least the sixth Century BCE; which is suspected of being the remains of the late Sao civilisation, which scholars suspect as being the result of waves of Nubian migrations into West Africa (further substantiating the claims that 'Bayajidda' hence Hausas, came from the "East").
In 1585 James VI appointed him Principal of the University of Glasgow.
Sub-groups such as the Gamergu, Kanembu, Sokoro, and Musgum all claim relations to one another as well as descent from the Sao.
From this time he took an important part in the government and controversies of the Scottish church, He seems to have wished to preserve a position of neutrality between the two parties which divided the kirk, but he gradually inclined to the king's party.
The Nostratic language family is a proposed macrofamily grouping together a number of language families including Indo-European, Uralic, Altaic, and more controversially Afroasiatic.
In 1586 he was placed on a commission charged by the general assembly to control the proceedings of the bishops.
Following Pedersen, Illich-Svitych, and Dolgopolsky, most advocates of the theory have included Afroasiatic in Nostratic, though criticisms by Joseph Greenberg and others from the late 1980s onward suggested a reassessment of this position.
In 1596 the general assembly appointed him and fifteen others to organise the church in opposition to the government.
Ilya Yabonovich and other linguists, in examining the differences between the various members of the Afroasiatic family have realised that all of the old etymologies for this group were inherently semitocentric.
Consequently, he was ordered by the privy council to return to Glasgow.
The differences between Chadic, Omotic, Cushitic and Semitic, were wider than those seen between any members of the Indo-European family and as wide as some of the differences seen within and between separate language families, for example, Indo-European and Altaic.
But in the same year he took part in the reactionary general assembly at Perth, and in 1597 he formed part of the commission to whom were delegated the powers of the general assembly when that body was not in session, and whose appointment paved the way for the re-establishment of episcopacy.
Certainly the exclusion of Afroasiatic from the controversial Nostratic family has simplified matters of phonemics, not having to include the complex patterns seen in Afroasiatic languages.
In 1606 Sharp was summoned to Hampton Court with seven other divines, to support the king's side in a debate with Andrew Melville and seven strong presbyterians, on the general questions at issue between king and kirk.
Allan Bomhard (1994) retains Afroasiatic within Nostratic, despite his admission that Proto–Afroasiatic is very different from the other members of the proposed linguistic Nostratic superfamily.
In the same year he was appointed constant moderator to the Glasgow presbytery in the absence of the bishop, and encountered such opposition that the privy council ordered the presbytery to receive him under pain of rebellion.
As a result, he suggests it was probably the first language to have split from the Nostratic linguistic superfamily.
The following year he was rebuked for endeavoring to extend the judicial powers of the presbytery to the decision of criminal cases.
Recently, however, a consensus has been emerging among proponents of the Nostratic hypothesis.
In 1609 Sharp took part in the Falkland conference, which was intended to make matters easy for the bishops at the general assembly.
Greenberg in fact basically agreed with the Nostratic concept, though he stressed a deep internal division between its northern 'tier' (his Eurasiatic) and a southern 'tier' (principally Afroasiatic and Dravidian).
On 15 May 1610 he was appointed to the Scottish court of high commission, and held the office till 11 August 1614.
The American Nostraticist Bomhard considers Eurasiatic a branch of Nostratic alongside other branches: Afroasiatic, Elamo-Dravidian, and Kartvelian.
He died in May 1615, having been twice married: first, to Mary Fowlls, widow of John Houlden of Balwill, on 1 September 1593, by whom he had two sons, David and Christian, and two daughters; and, secondly, to Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Gale of Eastwood, by whom he had a son James.
Similarly, Georgiy Starostin (2002) arrives at a tripartite overall grouping: he considers Afroasiatic, Nostratic and Elamite to be roughly equidistant and more closely related to each other than to anything else.
Sharp was the teacher of John Cameron.
Sergei Starostin's school has now re-included Afroasiatic in a broadly defined Nostratic, while reserving the term Eurasiatic to designate the narrower subgrouping which comprises the rest of the macrofamily.
Only one of his works survives, "Doctrinae Christianae brevis explicatio", printed by Robert Waldegrave in Edinburgh in 1599.
Recent proposals thus differ mainly on the precise placement of Dravidian and Kartvelian.
Igor Vladimirovich Mukhin (born 19 November 1961), also known as Igor Vladimirovich Moukhin, is a Russian photographer.
There was a major forest fire, the Dogrib Fire, in 2001, which threatened the community.
He is a member of the In-Public street photography collective.
In 2003, a major bridge was reconstructed in Bearberry.
After graduating from college, Mukhin worked in a project institute.
"Sour gas" is mined in and around Bearberry.
From 1985 to 1986 he attended classes at the studio of prominent Moscow photographer Alexander Lapin.
The area west of the community is described as "pristine wilderness area [that] is also home to the bear, wolf and cougar whose prey includes wild horses."
He later spent several years working with samizdat rock musicians.
Sugar panning, or simply panning, is a method for adding a candy "shell" to candy or nuts.
In 1987, Mukhin had his first personal exhibition at the Moscow State University.
Popular candies that employ this process in their manufacture include dragées, M&M's, gobstoppers, and jelly beans.
Since 1989 he has been working as an independent photographer.
Jelly beans use "soft" panning while the other three are examples of "hard" panning.
Mukhin is known for his photographs of Soviet rock musicians of the perestroika period, including Viktor Tsoi, Boris Grebenshchikov, and Petr Mamonov.
The process was initially invented in 17th century France to make jordan almonds.
His projects have included "The Soviet Monuments", "The Soviet Bench", "Fragments of Evident Propaganda", "The Soviet Children's Playgrounds", "Night Moscow", "Girls", "Moscow in Winter: Heavy Breath of Winter" and "The Province.
A dragée pan, a spherical or oval pan mounted on an angled spinning post, is used.
The Nizhniy Novgorod vacation".
The pan is open to the air to allow ingredients to be added and the syrup to dry.
Some of the photographs from these projects were shown at the Tretyakov gallery and La Maison Rouge in Paris in 2007.
The centers are put in the dragée pan, and syrup is added.
In the mid-1990s, Mukhin worked on documentary projects about Moscow and provincial Russia.
The pan spins, and the syrup is evenly distributed over the centers and dries on as a layer.
In 1996, he was a guest speaker at the international festival InterFoto in Moscow.
Soft panned layers can be quite thick and do not well preserve the shape of the center.
In 1999, Mukhin received a grant from the Paris Mayor's office to work on a project titled "Lovers in Paris" sponsored by FNAC (Fonds national d'art contemporain) and the French Committee to commemorate the year 2000.
Hard panned layers take longer to dry and can be as thin as 10-14μm.
Mukhin usually uses rangefinder cameras including the Leica M6 and black and white film.
The choice for centers is wide, but they must be strong enough to not break during the tumbling.
His work has been published in many Russian magazines and in foreign editions such as "Rolling Stone", "GEO", "Elle", "Vogue", "Le Monde", "Libération", "Esquire", and "Time" among others.
Nuts should be dried and sealed, such as with gum arabic and flour, to prevent oils from escaping and discoloring the candy shell.
In 2018 Mukhin became a member of the In-Public street photography collective.
Other centers may be precoated for sealing or to improve the syrup sticking to the center.
Alto de Santana ("Santana Heights") is a name commonly used, especially by business, to refer to an upper middle class area of Santana district in São Paulo city, Brazil.
Chewing gum is difficult to pan without precoating.
The term is used informally to refer to the bairro of Vila Santana "(Santana Village)" and the elevated region of the Santana bairro.
Soft panning uses a syrup that will not crystallize, such as glucose.
Among the major routes that pass through the region are: "Voluntários da Pátria street, Francisca Júlia street, Pedro Doll street, Doutor Guilherme Cristoffel street and Doutor Luis Lustosa da Silva street".
To assist in drying, powdered sugar or caster sugar is added during the tumble.
In Alto de Santana is located the Baruel Mansion, an old castle founded in the 19th century.
Prays ruficeps is a moth of the family Plutellidae.
The region is classified by CRECI (Federal Council of Real Estate) as Value of Zone B like other upper middle class areas of the capital: Brooklin, Cerqueira César e Paraíso.
It is found in Northern and Central Europe.
Abagrotis duanca is a moth of the Noctuidae family.
Janzen Jackson (born December 14, 1990) was an American football safety.
It is found in the Pacific Northwest of North America.
After playing college football for the University of Tennessee and McNeese State, he was signed by the New York Giants as an undrafted free agent in 2012.
In Alberta it has been collected only in the extreme southeastern corner.
Jackson initially attended Carencro High School in Lafayette, Louisiana until 2007 where his father, was the head coach of the football team.
The wingspan is about 28 mm.
There, Jackson honed his skills as a corner under his father's tutelage.
Adults are on wing from June to July in one generation in Alberta.
After totaling 93 tackles, 5 interceptions and blocking seven kicks as a junior, he was named Class 5A All-State by the LSWA.
Reported food plants include "Artemisia tridentata".
After his father returned to McNeese State, Jackson attended Alfred M. Barbe High School in Lake Charles, Louisiana, where he made 92 tackles and intercepted 5 passes as a senior.
The term Afroasiatic "Urheimat" refers to the hypothetical place where speakers of the proto-Afroasiatic language lived in a single linguistic community, or complex of communities, before this original language dispersed geographically and divided into separate distinct languages.
He was also named Class 5A All-State a second time and received All-American honors by "USA Today" and "SuperPrep".
This speech area is known as the "Urheimat" ("original homeland" in German).
In addition, Jackson participated in the U.S. Army All-American Bowl.
Afroasiatic languages are today distributed in parts of Africa and Western Asia.
Considered a five-star recruit by "Rivals.com", Jackson was listed as No. 2 cornerback in the 2009 class.
The contemporary Afroasiatic languages are spoken in the Near East, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, and parts of the Sahara/Sahel.
He originally committed to LSU on February 23, 2008, but rethought his choice on National Signing Day 2009, when he signed a national letter of intent to play football for Tennessee.
The various hypotheses for the Afroasiatic "Urheimat" are distributed throughout this territory; that is, it is generally assumed that proto-Afroasiatic was spoken in some region where Afroasiatic languages are still spoken today.
I love Tennessee.
However, there is argument as to which part of the contemporary Afroasiatic speech area corresponds with the original homeland.
I have known Coach Orgeron for a while and I love him.
The earliest written evidence of an Afroasiatic language is an Ancient Egyptian inscription dated c. 3400 BC (5,400 years ago).
But to realize that if you play defense at Tennessee, then you are going to know what Monte Kiffin knows is special.
Symbols on Gerzean pottery resembling Egyptian hieroglyphs date back to c. 4000 BC, suggesting a still earlier possible date.
He invented his own defense (Tampa 2) and has been so good for so long, and now he is going to teach me what he knows.
This gives us a minimum date for the age of Afroasiatic.
Despite Tennessee's depth in the defensive backfield, Jackson was expected to contribute as a true freshman in 2009.
However, Ancient Egyptian is highly divergent from proto-Afroasiatic (Trombetti 1905: 1–2), and considerable time must have elapsed in between them.
He arrived at Tennessee weighing 175 lbs, but bulked up to 192 lbs.
Estimates of the date at which the proto-Afroasiatic language was spoken vary widely.
According to head coach Lane Kiffin, Jackson "already covers like an SEC cornerback and hits like an SEC safety and has a chance to lineup alongside Eric Berry as a starter on September 5 against Western Kentucky."
They fall within a range between approximately 7,500 BC (9,500 years ago) and approximately 16,000 BC (18,000 years ago).
Until midseason, Jackson had started all but two of the Volunteers' games and had emerged as one of the better freshman players in the Southeastern Conference (SEC).
According to Igor M. Diakonoff (1988: 33n), proto-Afroasiatic was spoken c. 10,000 BC.
He was suspended for the week 9 game against Memphis for violating team rules.
According to Christopher Ehret (2002: 35–36), proto-Afroasiatic was spoken c. 11,000 BC at the latest, and possibly as early as c. 16,000 BC.
On November 12, 2009, Jackson and fellow freshmen teammates Mike Edwards and Nu'Keese Richardson were arrested after an armed robbery attempt at a Pilot station on Cumberland Avenue in Knoxville, Tennessee.
These dates are older than dates associated with most other protolanguages.
Less than two weeks later, charges against Jackson were dropped because a police investigation found that he had no prior knowledge of the alleged attempted robbery.
Culturally this falls within the period of the Halfan culture which may have been proto-Afroasiatic.
On November 24, he was reinstated to the Tennessee football team.
Supporters of a non-North or Northeast African origin for Afroasiatic are particularly common among those with a background in Semitic or Egyptological studies, or amongst archaeological proponents of the "farming/language dispersal hypothesis" according to which major language groups dispersed with early farming technology in the Neolithic.
After recording 37 tackles, a sack, an interception, a forced fumble, and a fumble recovery, Jackson was named to Rivals.com's 2009 SEC All-Freshman Team for his standout play.
The leading linguistic proponent of this idea in recent times is Alexander Militarev.
As a sophomore in 2010, Jackson started all 12 regular season games and compiled 65 tackles, 4 tackles for loss, a sack, 9 passes defended and 5 interceptions and was named to the All-SEC second team voted by the league's coaches.
Arguments for and against this position depend upon the contested proposal that farming-related words can be reconstructed in Proto-Afroasiatic, with farming technology being widely thought to have spread from the Levant into North Africa and then the Horn of Africa.
On August 24, 2011, the University of Tennessee announced that Janzen Jackson was released from the football team for unspecified reasons.
Militarev, who linked proto-Afroasiatic to the Levantine Natufian culture, that preceded the spread of farming technology, believes the language family to be about 10,000 years old.
On August 28, Jackson enrolled at McNeese State University, where his father, Guidry, played and coached for the McNeese State Cowboys football team.
He wrote (Militarev 2002, p. 135) that the "Proto-Afrasian language, on the verge of a split into daughter languages", meaning, in his scenario, into "Cushitic, Omotic, Egyptian, Semitic and Chadic-Berber", "should be roughly dated to the ninth millennium BC".
On April 29, 2012, Jackson signed with the New York Giants as an undrafted free agent.
But an Asiatic origin need not be associated exclusively with the migration of agricultural populations: according to linguists, words for dog (an Asian domesticate) reconstruct to Proto-Afroasiatic as well as words for bow and arrow, which according to archaeologists spread rapidly across North Africa once they were introduced from the Near East i.e. Ounan points.
On August 13, 2012, Jackson was waived by the team.
A scenario that also fits the linguistic evidence is one in which Afroasiatic languages were introduced into Africa together with advanced hunting techniques before the subsequent introduction of agriculture.
On February 21, 2013, Jackson signed with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League.
The Horn of Africa, particularly the area of Ethiopia and Eritrea, has been proposed by some linguists as the origin of the language group because it includes the majority of the diversity of the Afroasiatic language family and has very diverse groups in close geographic proximity, sometimes considered a telltale sign for a linguistic geographic origin.
He was released after playing five games.
Within this hypothesis there are several variants:
Jackson has a son named Ethan.
Although at Lake Turkana microlithic arrowheads appear in southern Africa (71,000 BP) and with the Aterian culture (30,000 BP) suggests that arrowheads "may" have been an invention originating in Africa taken into the Near East by a pre-Afroasiatic late glacial migration.
It is found in Central and Southern Europe, Algeria, Morocco, the Caucasus, Armenia, Turkey, North-Western Iran, Syria, Israel and Lebanon.
At the site of Nataruk in Turkana County, Kenya, obsidian bladelets found embedded in a skull and within the thoracic cavity of another skeleton, may suggest the use of stone-tipped arrows as weapons.
Darlington power station refers to a series of two coal-fired power stations situated in Darlington in County Durham, North East England.
After the end of the last glacial period, use of the bow seems to have spread to every inhabited continent, including the New World, except for Australia.
The first station was opened on the town's Haughton Road in 1900.
However, these finds predate by far any proposed date for the evolution of Afroasiatic.
It was positioned alongside the East Coast Main Line for the easy delivery of coal.
In the next phase, unlike many other authors Ehret proposed an initial split between northern, southern and Omotic.
The station needed replacing in the 1930s, and so a new station was built on the site.
The northern group includes Semitic, Egyptian and Berber (agreeing with others such as Diakonoff).
The station's construction cost £324,000, but was marred by numerous accidents and deaths.
He proposed that Chadic stems from Berber (some other authors group it with southern Afroasiatic languages such as Cushitic ones).
The new station opened in May 1940.
Another proposal is that Semitic is an offshoot of a northern family of Afroasiatic languages, including Berber, and possibly Egyptian.
It had three large hyperboloid reinforced concrete cooling towers and three brick built chimneys.
It then entered the Levant and was possibly spread by what Juris Zarins calls the Syro-Arabian nomadic pastoralism complex, spreading south along the shores of the Red Sea and northeast around the edge of the "Fertile Crescent".
The station had a generating capacity of 57 megawatts (MW).
It is thought that Semitic speakers then crossed from South Arabia back into Eritrea.
The Central Electricity Generating Board gave 12 months notification of the station's closure in October 1975.
In contrast, Bender proposed on linguistic grounds that Cushitic (found in the Horn of Africa) shares important innovations with Semitic and Berber, and that these three split off early from the others, while still near an original homeland of all Afroasiatic.
The station closed the following year, on 25 October 1976.
Igor Diakonoff proposed the Eastern Sahara region, specifically the southern fringe of the Sahara.
The cooling towers were demolished on 28 January 1979, and the chimneys were taken down by hand in 1978.
Lionel Bender proposed the area near Khartoum, Sudan, at the confluence of the Blue Nile and White Nile.
The Station building was demolished in 1979.
The details of his theory are widely cited but controversial, as it involves the proposal that Semitic originated in Ethiopia and crossed to Asia directly from there over the Red Sea.
Dry gas seals are non-contacting, dry-running mechanical face seals that consist of a mating (rotating) ring and a primary (stationary) ring.
This could also potentially solidify Bender's argument, in that scholars today believe that there is a relationship between the Cushitic branch and the Chadic Branch; arguing that perhaps Chadic descends from Cushitic.
When operating, lifting geometry in the rotating ring generates a fluid-dynamic lifting force causing the stationary ring to separate and create a gap between the two rings.
Prior to Colonialism the Hausa peoples of present-day Niger, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, and Chad were not united as a single polity, but rather they existed as a sequence of seven city-states (situated between the Niger River and Lake Chad); each with their own Sovereign dynasty named after their shared common progenitor known as Bayajidda, who apparently came from the "East" to which a great deal of scholars attribute to being the "Middle East', though this is contested.
Dry gas seals are mechanical seals but use other chemicals and functions so that they do not contaminate a process.
Each City-State were their own entities but were intertwined through trade, language, religion, customs, and ethnic identity/relations; hence comprising a sizable cultural stock that had greater trade links with larger states and empires such as the Ghana Empire, Mali Empire, Kanem-Bornu Empires, etc.
Machined-in lift profiles on one side of the seal face direct gas inward toward an extremely flat portion of the face.
In current day southwestern Chad and northeastern Cameroon in the Lake Chad Basin, there are several ethnic groups that also speak an Afroasiatic language similar to the Hausas.
The gas that is flowing across the face generates a pressure that maintains a minute gap between the faces, optimizing fluid film stiffness and providing the highest possible degree of protection against face contact.
They are known as respectively: the Biu–Mandara, Tumak, Nancere, Kera, Dangaléat, Mukulu, Sokoro, etc.
The seal's film stiffness compensates for varying operations by adjusting gap and pressure to maintain stability.
Together with the Hausa, they collectively comprise the Chadic branch of the Afro-Asiatic family.
Grooves or machined ramps on the seal direct gas inward toward the non-grooved portion.
There are also remnants of a civilization on the Cameroon side of Lake Chad that date back to at least the sixth Century BCE; which is suspected of being the remains of the late Sao civilisation, which scholars suspect as being the result of waves of Nubian migrations into West Africa (further substantiating the claims that 'Bayajidda' hence Hausas, came from the "East").
The action of the gas flowing across the seal generates pressure that keeps a minute gap, therefore optimizing fluid film stiffness and providing protection against face contact.
Sub-groups such as the Gamergu, Kanembu, Sokoro, and Musgum all claim relations to one another as well as descent from the Sao.
The use of these seals in centrifugal compressors has increased significantly in the last two decades because they eliminate contamination and do not use lubricating oil.
The Nostratic language family is a proposed macrofamily grouping together a number of language families including Indo-European, Uralic, Altaic, and more controversially Afroasiatic.
Non-contacting dry gas seals are often used on compressors for pipelines, off-shore applications, oil refineries, petrochemical and gas processing plants.
Following Pedersen, Illich-Svitych, and Dolgopolsky, most advocates of the theory have included Afroasiatic in Nostratic, though criticisms by Joseph Greenberg and others from the late 1980s onward suggested a reassessment of this position.
The first dry gas seal for a compressor was patented by Kaydon Ring & Seal in 1951 when it was known as Koppers Corporation.
Ilya Yabonovich and other linguists, in examining the differences between the various members of the Afroasiatic family have realised that all of the old etymologies for this group were inherently semitocentric.
Field applications of dry gas seal designs were completed in 1952.
The differences between Chadic, Omotic, Cushitic and Semitic, were wider than those seen between any members of the Indo-European family and as wide as some of the differences seen within and between separate language families, for example, Indo-European and Altaic.
From that first dry gas seal ever manufactured for a centrifugal compressor in 1951, Kaydon Ring & Seal has been instrumental in developing the dry gas seal into one of the most reliable and maintenance free sealing solution available today.
Certainly the exclusion of Afroasiatic from the controversial Nostratic family has simplified matters of phonemics, not having to include the complex patterns seen in Afroasiatic languages.
John Crane Inc. issued a patent for dry gas seals in 1968 with field applications beginning in 1975, though the technology is now widely available among seal manufacturers.
Allan Bomhard (1994) retains Afroasiatic within Nostratic, despite his admission that Proto–Afroasiatic is very different from the other members of the proposed linguistic Nostratic superfamily.
When the technology is aimed at correcting the problems with dry gas film environments by eliminating friction.
As a result, he suggests it was probably the first language to have split from the Nostratic linguistic superfamily.
The patented spiral-groove (constant depth / variable diameter) technology of the dry gas seal allows for easy lifting and separation of seal faces during operation.
Recently, however, a consensus has been emerging among proponents of the Nostratic hypothesis.
Also the dry gas seal lift geometry can be unidirectional or bidirectional, depending on the specific design of the lifting geometry.
Greenberg in fact basically agreed with the Nostratic concept, though he stressed a deep internal division between its northern 'tier' (his Eurasiatic) and a southern 'tier' (principally Afroasiatic and Dravidian).
Priest is a 2011 American action horror film directed by Scott Stewart and stars Paul Bettany as the title character.
The American Nostraticist Bomhard considers Eurasiatic a branch of Nostratic alongside other branches: Afroasiatic, Elamo-Dravidian, and Kartvelian.
It is loosely based on the Korean comic of the same name by Hyung Min-woo.
Similarly, Georgiy Starostin (2002) arrives at a tripartite overall grouping: he considers Afroasiatic, Nostratic and Elamite to be roughly equidistant and more closely related to each other than to anything else.
In an alternate universe, humanity and vampires have warred for centuries.
Sergei Starostin's school has now re-included Afroasiatic in a broadly defined Nostratic, while reserving the term Eurasiatic to designate the narrower subgrouping which comprises the rest of the macrofamily.
After the last Vampire War, a veteran Warrior Priest lives in obscurity until his niece (Lily Collins) is kidnapped by vampires.
Recent proposals thus differ mainly on the precise placement of Dravidian and Kartvelian.
The film was released on , 2011.
There was a major forest fire, the Dogrib Fire, in 2001, which threatened the community.
The film earned over $78 million at the box office against a $60 million production budget, but it was panned by critics, who, while noting the film's visual style, criticized the movie's use of genre clichés.
In 2003, a major bridge was reconstructed in Bearberry.
A centuries long war between humans and vampires has devastated the planet's surface and led to a theocracy under an organization called The Church.
Shell Oil has a plant near the community.
They constructed giant walled cities to protect mankind and developed a group of elite warriors, the Priests, to turn the tide against the vampires.
"Sour gas" is mined in and around Bearberry.
The majority of the vampires were killed, while the remainder were placed in reservations.
It is a tourist destination with snowmobile trails, and is also the site of a bed and breakfast.
With the war over, the Clergy disbanded the Priests.
The area west of the community is described as "pristine wilderness area [that] is also home to the bear, wolf and cougar whose prey includes wild horses."
Outside the walled cities, some humans seek out a living, free from the totalitarian control of the Church.

Popular candies that employ this process in their manufacture include dragées, M&M's, gobstoppers, and jelly beans.
Priest learns that his brother and his wife, Shannon - Priest's girlfriend before he entered the priesthood - were mortally wounded in a vampire attack, and Priest's niece, Lucy (Lily Collins), was kidnapped.
Jelly beans use "soft" panning while the other three are examples of "hard" panning.
Hicks asks for Priest's help in rescuing Lucy.
The process was initially invented in 17th century France to make jordan almonds.
Priest asks the Clergy to reinstate his authority, but Church leader Monsignor Orelas (Christopher Plummer) does not believe the vampire story and refuses, not wanting to discourage the idea that the Church completely defeated the vampires for fear of compromising their authority over the city.
Hard and soft panning both are made in a similar fashion, but with different ingredients and at different speeds.
Priest defiantly leaves the city and Orelas sends three Priests and a Priestess to bring him back.
A dragée pan, a spherical or oval pan mounted on an angled spinning post, is used.
Priest and Hicks arrive at Nightshade Reservation where humans called Familiars, people infected with a pathogen that makes them subservient to the vampires, live alongside a number of the surviving vampires.
The pan is open to the air to allow ingredients to be added and the syrup to dry.
After a fierce battle, the pair discovers that most of the vampires have taken shelter in Sola Mira, a vampire hive where Priest lost several of his comrades during a major battle.
The centers are put in the dragée pan, and syrup is added.
Priestess (Maggie Q) joins them at Sola Mira, revealing a bond with Priest.
The pan spins, and the syrup is evenly distributed over the centers and dries on as a layer.
The trio destroys a Hive Guardian vampire, then discover that the vampires have bred a new army and dug a tunnel out of the mountain towards a town called Jericho.
Soft panned layers can be quite thick and do not well preserve the shape of the center.
The other three Priests have arrived at Jericho just as night falls and an armored train arrives, unleashing hundreds of vampires upon the population.
Hard panned layers take longer to dry and can be as thin as 10-14μm.
The vampires are led by a powerful and mysterious human wearing a black hat.
The choice for centers is wide, but they must be strong enough to not break during the tumbling.
When the three Priests reject Black Hat's offer to join him, he kills them all.
Nuts should be dried and sealed, such as with gum arabic and flour, to prevent oils from escaping and discoloring the candy shell.
The next morning, Priest, Priestess and Hicks arrive in Jericho and discover the town empty and the three dead Priests crucified.
Other centers may be precoated for sealing or to improve the syrup sticking to the center.
Priest and Priestess share an intimate moment where she makes her move, hoping that now that Shannon has died, he would no longer feel bound to her.
Chewing gum is difficult to pan without precoating.
Priest, who is clearly not over Shannon, gently refuses.
Soft panning uses a syrup that will not crystallize, such as glucose.
Priest realizes that the vampires have been using the trains to travel by day and attack the free towns by night, with the walled cities at the end of the train line.
To assist in drying, powdered sugar or caster sugar is added during the tumble.
Hicks believes an attack on the cities would be unwise because of the sun, but Priest reveals that factories, producing massive clouds of smoke and ash, have permanently deprived the city of sunlight, so the vampire attack would be a slaughter.
Prays ruficeps is a moth of the family Plutellidae.
Hicks threatens Priest, claiming he will shoot him unless he promises to let Lucy live whether she has been infected or not.
It is found in Northern and Central Europe.
(Priest had earlier revealed to Hicks, who is in love with Lucy, that if they discovered Lucy had been infected as a Familiar, he would kill her.)
The wingspan is 14–17 mm.
Hicks does not understand why Priest, who is basically a stranger to Lucy, cares so much about her.
The larvae feed on "Fraxinus excelsior".
Priestess reveals that Lucy is actually Priest's daughter, and that his brother, Owen, stepped in as a husband and a father when Priest was taken by The Church.
Janzen Jackson (born December 14, 1990) was an American football safety.
While Priestess rushes ahead to plant a bomb on the railroad tracks, Priest and Hicks board the train to rescue Lucy.
After playing college football for the University of Tennessee and McNeese State, he was signed by the New York Giants as an undrafted free agent in 2012.
Battling vampires and Familiars, the two are finally overpowered by Black Hat just as they find Lucy.
Jackson initially attended Carencro High School in Lafayette, Louisiana until 2007 where his father, was the head coach of the football team.
Black Hat is revealed as one of the Priests who was defeated in the final attack on Sola Mira and a close friend of Priest.
There, Jackson honed his skills as a corner under his father's tutelage.
After being captured, the vampire Queen gave him her blood, turning him into the first Vampire-Human hybrid who can survive the sun.
After totaling 93 tackles, 5 interceptions and blocking seven kicks as a junior, he was named Class 5A All-State by the LSWA.
As Priest fights Black Hat, Lucy discovers the truth about her parentage.
After his father returned to McNeese State, Jackson attended Alfred M. Barbe High School in Lake Charles, Louisiana, where he made 92 tackles and intercepted 5 passes as a senior.
Priestess battles several Familiars, finally placing the explosives on her motor bike and crashing it into the train engine.
He was also named Class 5A All-State a second time and received All-American honors by "USA Today" and "SuperPrep".
The explosion and subsequent derailment kills the vampires and engulfs Black Hat in fire, while Hicks, Priest, Priestess, and Lucy are able to escape.
In addition, Jackson participated in the U.S. Army All-American Bowl.
Priest returns to the city and confronts Monsignor Orelas during Mass, telling him of the burnt train containing the vampires' bodies, but not the Queen's.
Considered a five-star recruit by "Rivals.com", Jackson was listed as No. 2 cornerback in the 2009 class.
He proves this by throwing a vampire head onto the floor and shocking everyone in the room.
He originally committed to LSU on February 23, 2008, but rethought his choice on National Signing Day 2009, when he signed a national letter of intent to play football for Tennessee.
Orelas still refuses to believe him, declaring that the war is over, while Priest says that it is just beginning.
Said Jackson: "Monte Kiffin was the difference.
Outside the city Priest meets Priestess, and she reveals that the other Priests have been notified and will meet them at a rendezvous point.
I love Tennessee.
Priest sets off into the sunset.
I have known Coach Orgeron for a while and I love him.
"Priest" is directed by Scott Stewart and written by Cory Goodman.
But to realize that if you play defense at Tennessee, then you are going to know what Monte Kiffin knows is special.
The film is based on the supernatural horror and action Korean comics "Priest" by Min-Woo Hyung.
He invented his own defense (Tampa 2) and has been so good for so long, and now he is going to teach me what he knows.
The project was first announced in March 2005 when the studio Screen Gems bought Goodman's spec script.
That was just too much to pass up."
In January 2006, Andrew Douglas, who directed "The Amityville Horror", was attached to direct "Priest".
Despite Tennessee's depth in the defensive backfield, Jackson was expected to contribute as a true freshman in 2009.
In June 2006, actor Gerard Butler entered negotiations to star as the title character, and filming was scheduled to start in Mexico on , 2006.
He arrived at Tennessee weighing 175 lbs, but bulked up to 192 lbs.
Filming did not proceed and, by three years later, director Douglas had been replaced by Stewart, while Butler had been replaced in the starring role by Paul Bettany.
According to head coach Lane Kiffin, Jackson "already covers like an SEC cornerback and hits like an SEC safety and has a chance to lineup alongside Eric Berry as a starter on September 5 against Western Kentucky."
Stewart and Bettany had previously worked together in the Screen Gems film "Legion".
Until midseason, Jackson had started all but two of the Volunteers' games and had emerged as one of the better freshman players in the Southeastern Conference (SEC).
With a budget of $60 million, filming began in August 2009 in Los Angeles, California, and it concluded in November 2009.
He was suspended for the week 9 game against Memphis for violating team rules.
The film was the most expensive production from Screen Gems, to that date, and as of 2018 is still tied for third most expensive, behind only "" and "".
On November 12, 2009, Jackson and fellow freshmen teammates Mike Edwards and Nu'Keese Richardson were arrested after an armed robbery attempt at a Pilot station on Cumberland Avenue in Knoxville, Tennessee.
Tokyopop flew Min-Woo Hyung to where production was taking place so the comics' creator could visit the art department and discuss the film with Stewart.
Less than two weeks later, charges against Jackson were dropped because a police investigation found that he had no prior knowledge of the alleged attempted robbery.
The film diverges from the comics in following a different timeline of events and adding elements of the sci-fi western, cyberpunk and post-apocalyptic science fiction genres.
On November 24, he was reinstated to the Tennessee football team.
The director described "Priest"s vampires as not being human in origin, and humans bitten by vampires became familiars instead.
After recording 37 tackles, a sack, an interception, a forced fumble, and a fumble recovery, Jackson was named to Rivals.com's 2009 SEC All-Freshman Team for his standout play.
Since the vampires were intended to move quickly, they were fully computer-generated for the film.
As a sophomore in 2010, Jackson started all 12 regular season games and compiled 65 tackles, 4 tackles for loss, a sack, 9 passes defended and 5 interceptions and was named to the All-SEC second team voted by the league's coaches.
While vampires are harmed by sunlight in most lore, the film's vampires are instead photosensitive, being albino cave-dwellers.
On August 24, 2011, the University of Tennessee announced that Janzen Jackson was released from the football team for unspecified reasons.
Stewart said, "They are the enemy we don't really understand, but we fought them for centuries.
On August 28, Jackson enrolled at McNeese State University, where his father, Guidry, played and coached for the McNeese State Cowboys football team.
The director also called "Priest" a homage to "The Searchers" with the title character being similar to John Wayne's character and the vampires being similar to the Comanche.
On April 29, 2012, Jackson signed with the New York Giants as an undrafted free agent.
The animated prologue for the film was created by American animator and director Genndy Tartakovsky.
On August 13, 2012, Jackson was waived by the team.
"Priest" was released in the United States and Canada on , 2011.
On February 21, 2013, Jackson signed with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League.
The film's release date changed numerous times in 2010 and 2011.
He was released after playing five games.
It was originally scheduled for , 2010, but it moved earlier to , 2010 to fill a weekend slot when another Screen Gems film, "", was postponed.
Jackson has a son named Ethan.
When the filmmakers wanted to convert "Priest" from 2D to 3D, the film was newly scheduled for release on , 2011.
His parents are Tesra Jackson.
It was delayed again to , 2011 so the film could attract summertime audiences.
Epilecta linogrisea is a moth of the family Noctuidae.
"Priest" was released outside the United States and Canada on , 2011 in four markets.
It is found in Central and Southern Europe, Algeria, Morocco, the Caucasus, Armenia, Turkey, North-Western Iran, Syria, Israel and Lebanon.
It grossed an estimated over the weekend, with "decent debuts" of in Russia and in Spain.
The wingspan is 32–41 mm.
It performed poorly in the United Kingdom with under $700,000.
The adults are on wing from May to September.
The film was released in the United States and Canada on , 2011 in with 2,006 having 3D screenings.
The larvae feed on various herbaceous plants, such as "Digitalis purpurea" and "Stellaria" and "Primula" species.
It grossed an estimated over the weekend, ranking fourth at the box office.
Darlington power station refers to a series of two coal-fired power stations situated in Darlington in County Durham, North East England.
Its performance was considered subpar compared to similar films in the "Underworld" series and "Resident Evil" series.
The first station was opened on the town's Haughton Road in 1900.
To date, "Priest" has grossed an estimated , of which was from North America.
It was positioned alongside the East Coast Main Line for the easy delivery of coal.
"Priest" was largely panned by critics.
The station needed replacing in the 1930s, and so a new station was built on the site.
Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 16% based on reviews from 92 critics and reports a rating average of 3.9 out of 10 with a consensus that ""Priest" is admittedly sleek and stylish, but those qualities are wasted on a dull, derivative blend of sci-fi, action, and horror clichés".
The station's construction cost £324,000, but was marred by numerous accidents and deaths.
At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 41 based on 13 reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews".
The new station opened in May 1940.
CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade audiences gave the film was a "C+" on an A+ to F scale.
It had three large hyperboloid reinforced concrete cooling towers and three brick built chimneys.
Chaturanga Dandasana (IAST: "Caturaṅga Daṇḍāsana") or Four-Limbed Staff Pose, also known as Low Plank, is a Yoga asana, in which a straight body parallel to the ground is supported by the toes and palms, with elbows at a right angle.
The station had a generating capacity of 57 megawatts (MW).
The name comes from the Sanskrit words "chatur" (IAST:catur) meaning "four", "anga" (IAST: aṅga) meaning "limb", "danda" (IAST:daṇḍa) meaning "staff" (refers to the spine, the central "staff" or support of the body), and "asana" (IAST:Āsana) meaning "posture" or "seat".
The Central Electricity Generating Board gave 12 months notification of the station's closure in October 1975.
In Chaturaṅga Daṇḍāsana the hands and feet are on the floor, supporting the body, which is parallel to and lowered toward, but not touching, the floor.
The station closed the following year, on 25 October 1976.
It looks much like a push up, but with the hands quite low (just above the pelvis), and the elbows kept in along the sides of the body.
The cooling towers were demolished on 28 January 1979, and the chimneys were taken down by hand in 1978.
When performed correctly, it can help prepare the body for arm balance asanas by strengthening important muscles and promoting good form.
The Station building was demolished in 1979.
In the sequences it is performed on an exhale, and the dṛṣṭi दृष्टि is the nāsāgra (नासाग्र) with the face pointing forwards.
Dry gas seals are non-contacting, dry-running mechanical face seals that consist of a mating (rotating) ring and a primary (stationary) ring.
In Sūrya Namaskāra A it is the fourth count (catvāri, चत्वारि), and in Sūrya Namaskāra B it is performed on the fourth, eighth and twelfth counts (catvāri, चत्वारि;aṣṭa,अष्ट;dvādaśa,द्वादश respectively).
When operating, lifting geometry in the rotating ring generates a fluid-dynamic lifting force causing the stationary ring to separate and create a gap between the two rings.
In yoga practice without vinyasa the asana is simply held for a period of time (for instance, 30 seconds) with continuous breathing.
Dry gas seals are mechanical seals but use other chemicals and functions so that they do not contaminate a process.
If unable to perform a standard Caturaṅga Daṇḍāsana, it can be done with the knees on the floor.
These seals are typically used in a harsh working environment such as oil exploration, extraction and refining, petrochemical industries, gas transmission and chemical processing.
This asana helps to tone arm and forearm muscles and develops flexibility and power in the wrists, as well as toning abdominal organs and building repository muscles.
Machined-in lift profiles on one side of the seal face direct gas inward toward an extremely flat portion of the face.
Due to the unique musculotendinous nature (this joint is not a junction of bones, but rather supported by muscles and tendons alone) of the scapulothoracic joint and unusual mobility of the glenohumeral joint involved in movement of the shoulder and upper back, weak serratus anterior may lead to winging of the shoulder blades in Caturaṅga Daṇḍāsana and cause shoulder and/or elbow pain and/or clicking.
The gas that is flowing across the face generates a pressure that maintains a minute gap between the faces, optimizing fluid film stiffness and providing the highest possible degree of protection against face contact.
Particularly in cases were Caturaṅga Daṇḍāsana or other chest strengthening asanas are practiced excessively, to the point of muscle exhaustion, which causes weaker, but anatomically more suited, muscles to hand their support responsibility over to stronger, but perhaps less ideal muscles; in the case of Caturaṅga Daṇḍāsana the triceps and pectoral muscles can sometimes compensate for weak serratus anterior.
The seal's film stiffness compensates for varying operations by adjusting gap and pressure to maintain stability.
This may require concerted professional help to re-educate the muscles and re-engage muscle action in the serratus anterior during such movements.
Grooves or machined ramps on the seal direct gas inward toward the non-grooved portion.
Lumbar hyperextension and hip flexion is a result of weakness in this asana, which can be corrected by activating the hamstrings.
The action of the gas flowing across the seal generates pressure that keeps a minute gap, therefore optimizing fluid film stiffness and providing protection against face contact.
The hips are adducted, rotated internally, and exhibit neutral extension.
The use of these seals in centrifugal compressors has increased significantly in the last two decades because they eliminate contamination and do not use lubricating oil.
The ankle is dorsiflexed.
Non-contacting dry gas seals are often used on compressors for pipelines, off-shore applications, oil refineries, petrochemical and gas processing plants.
The scapula is protracted or neutral.
The first dry gas seal for a compressor was patented by Kaydon Ring & Seal in 1951 when it was known as Koppers Corporation.
The elbow is flexed, and the wrist is extended.
Field applications of dry gas seal designs were completed in 1952.
The obliques, rectus abdominis and psoas minor work eccentrically to stabilize the spine, and the spinal muscles work concentrically.
The original patent was for Kaydon's "Tapered Ramp" lift geometry, a "constant diameter / variable depth" dynamic lift design.
The hamstrings, adductor magnus and gluteus maximus work concentrically in the legs, while the psoas major, iliacus, and rectus femoris work eccentrically keeping the hip in neutral extension.
From that first dry gas seal ever manufactured for a centrifugal compressor in 1951, Kaydon Ring & Seal has been instrumental in developing the dry gas seal into one of the most reliable and maintenance free sealing solution available today.
The vastii and articularis genus provide knee extension.
John Crane Inc. issued a patent for dry gas seals in 1968 with field applications beginning in 1975, though the technology is now widely available among seal manufacturers.
The gastrocnemius and soleus modulate the tibialis anterior to dorsiflex the foot, and finally the intrinsic and extrinsic foot muscles are active.
When the technology is aimed at correcting the problems with dry gas film environments by eliminating friction.
In the upper body the serratus anterior works eccentrically to prevent winging of the scapula.
Soon, the technology became a common replacement for other lubricated seals.
The muscles of the rotator cuff include the subscapularis (which protects the front of the joint), and the infraspinatus and teres minor (which work to externally rotate the humerus against the pull of the pectoralis and coracobrachialis).
The patented spiral-groove (constant depth / variable diameter) technology of the dry gas seal allows for easy lifting and separation of seal faces during operation.
The pectoralis major, pectoralis minor, coracobrachialis, and triceps work eccentrically.
Also the dry gas seal lift geometry can be unidirectional or bidirectional, depending on the specific design of the lifting geometry.
Exploding Head is the second album from the noise rock band A Place to Bury Strangers.
Priest is a 2011 American action horror film directed by Scott Stewart and stars Paul Bettany as the title character.
"In Your Heart" was released as the first single and "Keep Slipping Away" was released as a single on Monday 7 December 2009 in the UK.
It is loosely based on the Korean comic of the same name by Hyung Min-woo.
The album was a critical success and received a metascore of 79 out of 100.
In an alternate universe, humanity and vampires have warred for centuries.
Christian belief states that the name of God is not a human invention, but has divine origin and is based on divine revelation.
After the last Vampire War, a veteran Warrior Priest lives in obscurity until his niece (Lily Collins) is kidnapped by vampires.
Respect for the name of God is one of the Ten Commandments, which some Christian teachings interpret to be, not only a command to avoid the improper use God's name, but a directive to exalt it through both pious deeds and praise.
The film was released on , 2011.
This is reflected in the first petition in the Lord's Prayer addressed to God the Father: "Hallowed be Thy Name".
The film earned over $78 million at the box office against a $60 million production budget, but it was panned by critics, who, while noting the film's visual style, criticized the movie's use of genre clichés.
Going back to the Church Fathers, the name of God has been seen as a representation of the entire system of "divine truth" revealed to the faithful "that believe on his name" as in or "walk in the name of the our God" in .
A centuries long war between humans and vampires has devastated the planet's surface and led to a theocracy under an organization called The Church.
In those who bear the name of God are destined for Heaven.
They constructed giant walled cities to protect mankind and developed a group of elite warriors, the Priests, to turn the tide against the vampires.
presents the teachings of Jesus as the manifestation of the name of God to his disciples.
The majority of the vampires were killed, while the remainder were placed in reservations.
The Bible usually uses the name of God in the singular (e.g. Ex.
With the war over, the Clergy disbanded the Priests.
8:1), generally using the terms in a very general sense rather than referring to any special designation of God.
Outside the walled cities, some humans seek out a living, free from the totalitarian control of the Church.
However, general references to the name of God may branch to other special forms which express his multifaceted attributes.
Priest (Paul Bettany) is approached by Hicks (Cam Gigandet), the sheriff of Augustine, a free town.
Scripture presents many references to the names for God, but the key names in the Old Testament are: "God the High and Exalted One", "El Shaddai" and "YHWH" (on the meaning of the latter name there is almost no agreement).
Priest learns that his brother and his wife, Shannon - Priest's girlfriend before he entered the priesthood - were mortally wounded in a vampire attack, and Priest's niece, Lucy (Lily Collins), was kidnapped.
The Old Testament usually uses the name of God in the singular (e.g. Ex.
Hicks asks for Priest's help in rescuing Lucy.
8:1), generally using the terms in a very general sense rather than referring to any special designation of God.
Priest asks the Clergy to reinstate his authority, but Church leader Monsignor Orelas (Christopher Plummer) does not believe the vampire story and refuses, not wanting to discourage the idea that the Church completely defeated the vampires for fear of compromising their authority over the city.
However, the general name of God may branch to other special names which express his multifaceted attributes.
Priest defiantly leaves the city and Orelas sends three Priests and a Priestess to bring him back.
The simplest form by which God is referred to in the Old Testament is El, likely derived from His being first and foremost.
Priest and Hicks arrive at Nightshade Reservation where humans called Familiars, people infected with a pathogen that makes them subservient to the vampires, live alongside a number of the surviving vampires.
(see proper names of earlier Canaanite gods) Elohim (singular Eloah) is likely derived from the same root and points to God as being strong and mighty, able to judge and to strike fear.
After a fierce battle, the pair discovers that most of the vampires have taken shelter in Sola Mira, a vampire hive where Priest lost several of his comrades during a major battle.
Elyon refers to elevation and being exalted.
Priestess (Maggie Q) joins them at Sola Mira, revealing a bond with Priest.
Adonai has a similar context and refers to God as a powerful ruler.
The trio destroys a Hive Guardian vampire, then discover that the vampires have bred a new army and dug a tunnel out of the mountain towards a town called Jericho.
Similarly, El Shaddai, derived from "shad" i.e. Lord, also points to the power of God.
The other three Priests have arrived at Jericho just as night falls and an armored train arrives, unleashing hundreds of vampires upon the population.
Yahweh is the principal name in the Old Testament by which God reveals himself and is the most sacred, distinctive and incommunicable name of God.
The vampires are led by a powerful and mysterious human wearing a black hat.
Based on Lev, 24:16: "He that blasphemes the name of Yahweh shall surely be put to death", Jews generally avoided the use of Yahweh and substituted Adonai or Elohim for it when reading Scripture.
When the three Priests reject Black Hat's offer to join him, he kills them all.
The pronunciation of YHWH in the Old Testament can never be certain, given that the original Hebrew text only used consonants.
The next morning, Priest, Priestess and Hicks arrive in Jericho and discover the town empty and the three dead Priests crucified.
The English form Jehovah was formed during the Middle Ages by combining the Latinization of the four consonants YHWH with the vowel points that Masoretes used to indicate that the reader should say Adonai when YHWH was encountered.
Priest and Priestess share an intimate moment where she makes her move, hoping that now that Shannon has died, he would no longer feel bound to her.
Thus Jehovah was obtained by adding the vowels of Adonai to the consonants of YHWH.
Priest, who is clearly not over Shannon, gently refuses.
Jehovah appears in Tyndale's Bible, the King James Version, and other translations from that time period and later.
Priest realizes that the vampires have been using the trains to travel by day and attack the free towns by night, with the walled cities at the end of the train line.
Many English translations of the Bible translate the Tetragrammaton as "", following the Jewish practice of substituting Adonai for it.
Hicks believes an attack on the cities would be unwise because of the sun, but Priest reveals that factories, producing massive clouds of smoke and ash, have permanently deprived the city of sunlight, so the vampire attack would be a slaughter.
In the same sense as the substitution of Adonai, the Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Bible to Greek mainly used the word "Kyrios" (meaning 'lord') for YHWH.
Hicks threatens Priest, claiming he will shoot him unless he promises to let Lucy live whether she has been infected or not.
Apostle Paul was likely familiar with the use of the term Kyrios in the Septuagint and used it in his letters to refer to Jesus, thus signifying his divinity.
(Priest had earlier revealed to Hicks, who is in love with Lucy, that if they discovered Lucy had been infected as a Familiar, he would kill her.)
The pronouncement "I Am that I Am" in Exodus 3:14, in rabbinical scholarship taken as a gloss on the meaning of the Tetragrammaton, was in Hellenistic Judaism rendered as .
Hicks does not understand why Priest, who is basically a stranger to Lucy, cares so much about her.
In the iconographic tradition of Eastern Christianity, it is common to depict Christ with a cruciform halo inscribed with the letters Ο, Ω, Ν for "He Who Is".
Priestess reveals that Lucy is actually Priest's daughter, and that his brother, Owen, stepped in as a husband and a father when Priest was taken by The Church.
While the Old Testament has a wide variety of names and epithets that refer to God in Hebrew, the Greek text of the New Testament uses far fewer variants.
While Priestess rushes ahead to plant a bomb on the railroad tracks, Priest and Hicks board the train to rescue Lucy.
The essential uses of the name of God the Father in the New Testament are "Theos" (θεός the Greek term for God), "Kyrios" (i.e. Lord in Greek) and "Patēr" (πατήρ i.e. Father in Greek).
Battling vampires and Familiars, the two are finally overpowered by Black Hat just as they find Lucy.
The Aramaic word "Abba" (אבא), meaning "Father" is used by Jesus in and also appears in Romans 8:15 and Galatians 4:6.
Black Hat is revealed as one of the Priests who was defeated in the final attack on Sola Mira and a close friend of Priest.
In the New Testament the two names Jesus and Emmanuel that refer to Jesus have salvific attributes.
After being captured, the vampire Queen gave him her blood, turning him into the first Vampire-Human hybrid who can survive the sun.
The name Jesus is given in and and in both cases the name is not selected by humans but is received by angelic messages with theological significance, e.g. the statement in Matthew 1:21 "you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save his people from their sins" associates salvific attributes to the name Jesus.
As Priest fights Black Hat, Lucy discovers the truth about her parentage.
Emmanuel which appears in Matthew 1:23 may refer to , and does not appear elsewhere in the New Testament, but in the context of ("I am with you always, even unto the end of the world") indicates that Jesus will be with the faithful to the end of the age.
Priestess battles several Familiars, finally placing the explosives on her motor bike and crashing it into the train engine.
According to Ulrich Luz, the Emmanuel motif brackets the entire Gospel of Matthew between 1:23 and 28:20, appearing explicitly and implicitly in several other passages, setting the tone for the salvific theme of Matthew.
The explosion and subsequent derailment kills the vampires and engulfs Black Hat in fire, while Hicks, Priest, Priestess, and Lucy are able to escape.
The names of the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit are inherently related in the New Testament, e.g. with Jesus' instruction to His disciples at the end of the Gospel of Matthew :"make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit".
Priest returns to the city and confronts Monsignor Orelas during Mass, telling him of the burnt train containing the vampires' bodies, but not the Queen's.
The Greek word "pneuma", generally translated "spirit", is found around 385 times in the New Testament.
He proves this by throwing a vampire head onto the floor and shocking everyone in the room.
The English terms "Holy Spirit" and "Holy Ghost" have identical meanings, with the former having become the usual term in the 20th century.
Orelas still refuses to believe him, declaring that the war is over, while Priest says that it is just beginning.
The First Epistle of John then contrasts this with the "spirit of error" in .
Outside the city Priest meets Priestess, and she reveals that the other Priests have been notified and will meet them at a rendezvous point.
Although in some modern cultures names are simply labels and designators that distinguish one item from another, in Christian theology the names of God have always had much deeper meaning and significance.
Priest sets off into the sunset.
In the religious sense, the names of God are not human inventions, but have divine origin and are based on divine revelation.
"Priest" is directed by Scott Stewart and written by Cory Goodman.
Veneration of the name of God goes back to the Old Testament, and as in , the Ten Commandments state: "You shall not make wrongful use of the name of the L your God".
The film is based on the supernatural horror and action Korean comics "Priest" by Min-Woo Hyung.
Christians teachings view this commandment as not simply an avoidance of the use of the name of God, but as a directive to exalt it, through both pious deeds and praise.
The project was first announced in March 2005 when the studio Screen Gems bought Goodman's spec script.
In Christian teachings, the name of God is not simply a label, but involves divine mysteries that require and preempt respect and praise.
In January 2006, Andrew Douglas, who directed "The Amityville Horror", was attached to direct "Priest".
Louis Berkhof states that the issue surrounding the use and interpretation of the names of God provide a theological puzzle in that given that God is "infinite and incomprehensible", His names transcend human thought, yet they allow Him to be revealed to humans as he descends to what is finite and comprehensible.
In June 2006, actor Gerard Butler entered negotiations to star as the title character, and filming was scheduled to start in Mexico on , 2006.
Thus the name of God has always been revered in the Christian tradition, and has been associated with His presence.
Filming did not proceed and, by three years later, director Douglas had been replaced by Stewart, while Butler had been replaced in the starring role by Paul Bettany.
The traditions and the hymnody of Christian liturgy have for long emphasized the importance of acting in the name of God, e.g. the Sanctus (which may go) states: "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord".
Stewart and Bettany had previously worked together in the Screen Gems film "Legion".
Going back to Church Fathers such as Cyril of Alexandria, in Christian teachings the name of God has been seen as a representation of the entire system of "divine truth" revealed to the faithful "that believe on His name" as in or "walk in the name of the Lord our God" in .
With a budget of $60 million, filming began in August 2009 in Los Angeles, California, and it concluded in November 2009.
This is further shown in Jesus' Farewell Discourse to His disciples at the end of the Last Supper, in which He addresses the Father and in and states:
The film was the most expensive production from Screen Gems, to that date, and as of 2018 is still tied for third most expensive, behind only "" and "".
In those who bear the name of God are destined for Heaven.
Tokyopop flew Min-Woo Hyung to where production was taking place so the comics' creator could visit the art department and discuss the film with Stewart.
In Christian teachings, although the people of God bear the name of God, even they can offend the name of God by transgressing against the nature of God, and disobeying His commandments, as in : "For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you, even as it is written."
The film diverges from the comics in following a different timeline of events and adding elements of the sci-fi western, cyberpunk and post-apocalyptic science fiction genres.
She was born in Iraq and grew up in Beirut, Lebanon.
The director described "Priest"s vampires as not being human in origin, and humans bitten by vampires became familiars instead.
She started her career as an actress on BBC's "Casualty".
There are different forms of vampires, such as hive drones, guardians, and a queen.
She wrote, directed, and starred in the feature "" (2005) which won the Viewer's Voice Award at Cinequest Film Festival in San Jose, California.
Since the vampires were intended to move quickly, they were fully computer-generated for the film.
White Stuff is a British fashion and lifestyle brand that sells women’s, men’s and kids' clothing, accessories, homeware and gifts in over 115 shops in the United Kingdom, shops in Germany, via mail-order catalogues and through its website.
While vampires are harmed by sunlight in most lore, the film's vampires are instead photosensitive, being albino cave-dwellers.
The brand has become known for its traditional British styles, idiosyncratic boutique stores and innovative marketing campaigns.
Stewart said, "They are the enemy we don't really understand, but we fought them for centuries.
White Stuff was founded in 1985 when two friends, George Treves and Sean Thomas, decided to form a business to fund their love for skiing.
They are mysterious and alien, with their own culture.
Starting under the name “Boys from the White Stuff”, their printed T-shirts and sweatshirts became instantly popular in the alpine region of Val d'Isère.
You sense that they think and communicate, but you don't really understand what they are saying."
The pair opened the first White Stuff Clothing store in London in 1991.
The director also called "Priest" a homage to "The Searchers" with the title character being similar to John Wayne's character and the vampires being similar to the Comanche.
White Stuff was founded in 1985 by two friends, George Treves and Sean Thomas.
The animated prologue for the film was created by American animator and director Genndy Tartakovsky.
Keen skiers, the pair decided to work together to find a way of funding their passion.
"Priest" was released in the United States and Canada on , 2011.
They devised a business plan to sell T-shirts with abstract motifs that would appeal to skiers.
The film's release date changed numerous times in 2010 and 2011.
They thought up the name "Boys from the White Stuff" – a play on the title of the popular film and TV series “Boys from the Blackstuff” by Alan Bleasdale.
It was originally scheduled for , 2010, but it moved earlier to , 2010 to fill a weekend slot when another Screen Gems film, "", was postponed.
Sean Thomas sold the initial batch of 100 T-shirts very quickly in the company’s inaugural year, while George Treves stayed at home in the UK to work on a course at catering college.
When the filmmakers wanted to convert "Priest" from 2D to 3D, the film was newly scheduled for release on , 2011.
The following season, they began printing sweatshirts as well as T-shirts which, according to Treves, “started to gain Alpine kudos as a grass roots level; it had an aspirational value for holidaymakers who had seen ski workers wearing it”.
It was delayed again to , 2011 so the film could attract summertime audiences.
Treves and Thomas toured the French Alpine ski resort town of Val d'Isère, selling their products in hotels and bars from a suitcase.
"Priest" was released outside the United States and Canada on , 2011 in four markets.
During the off-seasons, when they could not sell their garments, Treves worked as a decorator and Thomas as a driver.
It grossed an estimated over the weekend, with "decent debuts" of in Russia and in Spain.
At the turn of the 21st Century, Treves and Thomas were continuing to design White Stuff’s clothing lines.
It performed poorly in the United Kingdom with under $700,000.
In February 2004 Thomas and Treves hired Sally Bailey, former Brand Director of Miss Selfridge, to help develop the brand.
The film was released in the United States and Canada on , 2011 in with 2,006 having 3D screenings.
Over the next five years, Bailey moved the White Stuff label away from its original image as a winter wear retailer to begin focusing on a more bohemian, urban audience.
It grossed an estimated over the weekend, ranking fourth at the box office.
Bailey stepped down from her position as CEO in 2013 and was replaced by Jeremy Seigal, formerly of Watson and The Perfume Shop.
Its performance was considered subpar compared to similar films in the "Underworld" series and "Resident Evil" series.
In 2018, Jo Jenkins, previously at Marks and Spencer joined the company as CEO.
To date, "Priest" has grossed an estimated , of which was from North America.
By 2018, the company had grown to have more than 115 stores across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, including stores in Guernsey and Isle of Man.
"Priest" was largely panned by critics.
The White Stuff Foundation was founded in May 2010, in celebration of the company's 25th anniversary.
Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 16% based on reviews from 92 critics and reports a rating average of 3.9 out of 10 with a consensus that ""Priest" is admittedly sleek and stylish, but those qualities are wasted on a dull, derivative blend of sci-fi, action, and horror clichés".
Today the foundation is based in Lambeth, London.
At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 41 based on 13 reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews".
White Stuff Clothing stated their aim to fulfil 25 pledges to show White Stuff's social and environmental commitments, and in particular aims at helping disadvantaged young people.
CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade audiences gave the film was a "C+" on an A+ to F scale.
Currently the White Stuff Foundation supports more than 100 small and local charities in the UK.
Chaturanga Dandasana (IAST: "Caturaṅga Daṇḍāsana") or Four-Limbed Staff Pose, also known as Low Plank, is a Yoga asana, in which a straight body parallel to the ground is supported by the toes and palms, with elbows at a right angle.
These are predominantly in the urban areas close to White Stuff's stores and distribution centres, and every branch of White Stuff is partnered with its own charity.
The name comes from the Sanskrit words "chatur" (IAST:catur) meaning "four", "anga" (IAST: aṅga) meaning "limb", "danda" (IAST:daṇḍa) meaning "staff" (refers to the spine, the central "staff" or support of the body), and "asana" (IAST:Āsana) meaning "posture" or "seat".
The White Stuff Foundation also supports two charities in India and two in Denmark.
In Chaturaṅga Daṇḍāsana the hands and feet are on the floor, supporting the body, which is parallel to and lowered toward, but not touching, the floor.
Donations accepted by the White Stuff Foundation go towards supporting these partner charities.
It looks much like a push up, but with the hands quite low (just above the pelvis), and the elbows kept in along the sides of the body.
White Stuff stores are responsible for hosting their own fundraising events.
When performed correctly, it can help prepare the body for arm balance asanas by strengthening important muscles and promoting good form.
This has led to the creation of many campaigns, including Surf Relief, Give a Gnome a Home, National Wear a Tea Cosy on Your Head Day and Charity Flip Flops, as well as local events, such as bake sales and raffles throughout each year.
In vinyasa styles of yoga, Caturaṅga Daṇḍāsana is part of the Sun Salutations Sūrya Namaskāra A and B.
White Stuff stores will also sell the props used as part of their window displays at the end of every season, with proceeds going to the White Stuff Foundation.
In the sequences it is performed on an exhale, and the dṛṣṭi दृष्टि is the nāsāgra (नासाग्र) with the face pointing forwards.
In 1991, the first White Stuff shop was opened in Clapham, London.
In Sūrya Namaskāra A it is the fourth count (catvāri, चत्वारि), and in Sūrya Namaskāra B it is performed on the fourth, eighth and twelfth counts (catvāri, चत्वारि;aṣṭa,अष्ट;dvādaśa,द्वादश respectively).
White Stuff boutiques are, according to the company website, “more than just shops, they are places where people can meet and socialise.”
In yoga practice without vinyasa the asana is simply held for a period of time (for instance, 30 seconds) with continuous breathing.
White Stuff regularly hosts events inside its stores (including the regular White Stuff Book Club), allows customers to bring pets inside with them, and has dedicated areas for children with colouring books and dens.
If unable to perform a standard Caturaṅga Daṇḍāsana, it can be done with the knees on the floor.
Some White Stuff stores include their own cinemas, pick ‘n’ mix counters and bespoke changing rooms decorated in themed styles.
This asana helps to tone arm and forearm muscles and develops flexibility and power in the wrists, as well as toning abdominal organs and building repository muscles.
White Stuff has more than 100 stores including Edinburgh, Nottingham, Manchester and Battersea.
Due to the unique musculotendinous nature (this joint is not a junction of bones, but rather supported by muscles and tendons alone) of the scapulothoracic joint and unusual mobility of the glenohumeral joint involved in movement of the shoulder and upper back, weak serratus anterior may lead to winging of the shoulder blades in Caturaṅga Daṇḍāsana and cause shoulder and/or elbow pain and/or clicking.
The Curtiss Model 57 Teal was an American monoplane amphibian designed and built by the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company.
Particularly in cases were Caturaṅga Daṇḍāsana or other chest strengthening asanas are practiced excessively, to the point of muscle exhaustion, which causes weaker, but anatomically more suited, muscles to hand their support responsibility over to stronger, but perhaps less ideal muscles; in the case of Caturaṅga Daṇḍāsana the triceps and pectoral muscles can sometimes compensate for weak serratus anterior.
Two versions were built, a three-seater and four-seater but only one of each was built.
This may require concerted professional help to re-educate the muscles and re-engage muscle action in the serratus anterior during such movements.
The Teal was a monoplane amphibian with the pusher engine pod-mounted above the wing center section.
Lumbar hyperextension and hip flexion is a result of weakness in this asana, which can be corrected by activating the hamstrings.
It was designed for the private user, but due to the economic pressures of 1930s America only one three-seater (Teal A-1 registered "N969V" ) and one four-seater (Teal B-1 registered "N970V") were built.
The spine and sacroiliac joint are neutral.
The Noctes Ambrosianae, a series of 71 imaginary colloquies, appeared in "Blackwood's Magazine" from 1822 to 1835.
The hips are adducted, rotated internally, and exhibit neutral extension.
The earlier ones had several different authors, including John Gibson Lockhart, William Maginn, James Hogg and Professor John Wilson, but from 1825, with the 19th in the series, the contributions by Wilson predominate, and he eventually wrote all or most of 39 of the dialogues, as well as parts of some others.
The knee is extended.
The scene is usually set in Ambrose's Tavern in Edinburgh, and the central characters are "Christopher North" (Wilson himself), "Timothy Tickler" (based on Robert Sym, 1750-1840, previously a Writer to the Signet), and the "Ettrick Shepherd" (based on James Hogg).
The ankle is dorsiflexed.
Several other characters, imaginary or based on real people, including the "English Opium Eater" (Thomas de Quincey) and "The tailor o' Yarrow Ford" (David Brunton) occur in some episodes.
The scapula is protracted or neutral.
The series is particularly noted for the expressive Scots dialogue of the Ettrick Shepherd.
The glenohumeral joint is neutral.
Fractured is the second novel in the "Atlanta" series from bestselling author Karin Slaughter.
The elbow is flexed, and the wrist is extended.
This book was published in 2008.
The obliques, rectus abdominis and psoas minor work eccentrically to stabilize the spine, and the spinal muscles work concentrically.
The books also feature Angie Polaski and Faith Mitchell.
The hamstrings, adductor magnus and gluteus maximus work concentrically in the legs, while the psoas major, iliacus, and rectus femoris work eccentrically keeping the hip in neutral extension.
Slaughter also writes the Grant County series.
The vastii and articularis genus provide knee extension.
The audiobook is narrated by Phil Gigante.
The gastrocnemius and soleus modulate the tibialis anterior to dorsiflex the foot, and finally the intrinsic and extrinsic foot muscles are active.
Six months ago, Atlanta homicide detective Faith Mitchell's police captain mother was the focus of an investigation that resulted in her retirement and the firing of six narcotics officers.
In the upper body the serratus anterior works eccentrically to prevent winging of the scapula.
It was a righteous bust, but the cops want to protect their own, and Faith, along with the entire Atlanta police force, simmers with rage at the man responsible, GBI agent Will Trent.
The muscles of the rotator cuff include the subscapularis (which protects the front of the joint), and the infraspinatus and teres minor (which work to externally rotate the humerus against the pull of the pectoralis and coracobrachialis).
Now Faith and Will are thrown together on a shocking murder/kidnapping case involving some of the wealthiest and most powerful families in the city, and neither one of them is happy about the pairing.
The pectoralis major, pectoralis minor, coracobrachialis, and triceps work eccentrically.
But Faith gradually discovers that not only is Will not the verminous heel she expected him to be, he is a sleuth par excellence, and Will must deal with a bully from his past who is now a victim and whose irrational hostility threatens the investigation.
The pronators and the intrinsic and extrinsic hand muscles are also active.
As the case begins to center on dyslexia, Will waits nervously to see if anyone will notice his own, and he and Faith race frantically from the dormitories of Georgia Tech to the halls of one of Atlanta's exclusive private academies to keep another corpse from surfacing.
Exploding Head is the second album from the noise rock band A Place to Bury Strangers.
It is located a few kilometers south of the city of Chimaltenango in Guatemala.
It is their first release on a major label and the first album for their new label Mute Records.
It was formerly known as "Finca la Alameda" and renamed to Los Aposentos in 1929.
"In Your Heart" was released as the first single and "Keep Slipping Away" was released as a single on Monday 7 December 2009 in the UK.
An area of 0.15 km², including the lakes was declared a national park in 1955.
The album was a critical success and received a metascore of 79 out of 100.
It holds 16 vehicles (tied with the MV "Nimpkish"), 138 passengers and crew, and its maximum speed is .
In Christian theology the name of God has always had much deeper meaning and significance than being just a label or designator.
The "Mill Bay" operated in the Brentwood Bay-Mill Bay route across Saanich Inlet on Vancouver Island.
Christian belief states that the name of God is not a human invention, but has divine origin and is based on divine revelation.
The Brentwood Bay to Mill Bay ferry started operation in November 1924 by two former naval officers, Kennaird and Williams, and it is the oldest continuous ferry service on the coast of British Columbia.
Respect for the name of God is one of the Ten Commandments, which some Christian teachings interpret to be, not only a command to avoid the improper use God's name, but a directive to exalt it through both pious deeds and praise.
Initial service by the Cascade Freight and Trading Company was provided with a 22-year-old wooden hulled coastal steamer the SS "Cascade", which was altered to allow cars to drive on or off the bow and the stern.
This is reflected in the first petition in the Lord's Prayer addressed to God the Father: "Hallowed be Thy Name".
The "Cascade" underwent many more alterations over the years, including replacement of her steam engines with internal combustion engines,
Going back to the Church Fathers, the name of God has been seen as a representation of the entire system of "divine truth" revealed to the faithful "that believe on his name" as in or "walk in the name of the our God" in .
and was eventually rechristened the "Brentwood".
In those who bear the name of God are destined for Heaven.
Cascade Freight and Trading Company was bought by Coast Ferries Ltd. in 1945.
presents the teachings of Jesus as the manifestation of the name of God to his disciples.
In the 1950s the more-than-50-year-old "Brentwood" was aging and in need of replacement.
The Bible usually uses the name of God in the singular (e.g. Ex.
Coast Ferries Ltd. contracted out the construction of a new steel hulled ferry to the Victoria Machinery Depot firm in Victoria.
20:7 or Ps.
On July 20, 1956 the "Mill Bay" entered service across the Saanich Inlet route and for two years both the "Mill Bay" and the older "Brentwood" both crossed the inlet while the portion of the Island Highway over the Malahat pass was being paved.
8:1), generally using the terms in a very general sense rather than referring to any special designation of God.
In 1969 Coast Ferries Ltd. was bought out by BC Ferries (that had formed in 1960).
However, general references to the name of God may branch to other special forms which express his multifaceted attributes.
Thus "Mill Bay" is a vessel four years older than the company that currently runs her and is the oldest working ferry in the BC Ferries fleet.
Scripture presents many references to the names for God, but the key names in the Old Testament are: "God the High and Exalted One", "El Shaddai" and "YHWH" (on the meaning of the latter name there is almost no agreement).
The Mill Bay terminal was used for a scene during the filming of the 1970 movie "Five Easy Pieces" that starred Jack Nicholson
In the New Testament "Theos", "Kyrios" and "Patēr" (πατήρ i.e. Father in Greek) are the essential names.
On May 29, 1989 "Mill Bay" ran aground on the beach just south of the Mill Bay ferry terminal.
The Old Testament usually uses the name of God in the singular (e.g. Ex.
No damage resulted and she was pulled safely back into deeper water.
20:7 or Ps.
The subsequent investigation discovered that the captain at the time had fallen asleep since he had just participated in the Swiftsure Yacht Race.
8:1), generally using the terms in a very general sense rather than referring to any special designation of God.
On July 5, 1989 the "Mill Bay" was crossing Saanich Inlet when a problem arose with the fuel line and the engine lost power.
However, the general name of God may branch to other special names which express his multifaceted attributes.
As the ferry drifted the fuel line was repaired and the ferry eventually made it to shore under her own power.
The simplest form by which God is referred to in the Old Testament is El, likely derived from His being first and foremost.
In 2000 BC Ferries proposed eliminating the service provided by the "Mill Bay" but local protest was strong enough to counter the proposal and preserve the service.
(see proper names of earlier Canaanite gods) Elohim (singular Eloah) is likely derived from the same root and points to God as being strong and mighty, able to judge and to strike fear.
In 2001 the "Mill Bay" was removed from service for two months in the summer to undergo refurbishment that included replacement of several sections of steel plating in the hull, extension of the bridge, and the addition of radar.
Elyon refers to elevation and being exalted.
In addition, the terminals in Mill Bay and Brentwood Bay were upgraded with all repairs to the terminals and vessel costing approximately $3.8 million (CAD).
These are, however, not proper names for God, but epithets also used for rulers and judges.
The 80th anniversary of the ferry route was celebrated on November 27, 2004 at the Brentwood Bay terminal and aboard the "Mill Bay".
Adonai has a similar context and refers to God as a powerful ruler.
On February 1, 2005 three men fell into Brentwood Bay when their canoe capsized.
Similarly, El Shaddai, derived from "shad" i.e. Lord, also points to the power of God.
Reacting to the incident the crew aboard the "Mill Bay" picked up two of the men and the third was picked up by the Brentwood Bay Coast Guard Auxiliary.
Yahweh is the principal name in the Old Testament by which God reveals himself and is the most sacred, distinctive and incommunicable name of God.
Raymond J. Parker reported in 2009 that the "Mill Bay" was used by cyclists in a significant shortcut for a Vancouver Island 300 km bike route known as "Tsunami II".
Based on Lev, 24:16: "He that blasphemes the name of Yahweh shall surely be put to death", Jews generally avoided the use of Yahweh and substituted Adonai or Elohim for it when reading Scripture.
"Mill Bay" is equipped with three lanes for cars, two with no height restriction and one lane that passes under the superstructure for the wheelhouse.
The pronunciation of YHWH in the Old Testament can never be certain, given that the original Hebrew text only used consonants.
Since the trip across the inlet takes only 20 minutes "Mill Bay" does not have very many amenities.
The English form Jehovah was formed during the Middle Ages by combining the Latinization of the four consonants YHWH with the vowel points that Masoretes used to indicate that the reader should say Adonai when YHWH was encountered.
The "Mill Bay" is powered by an L. Gardner and Sons model 8L3 straight-eight engine that generates .
Thus Jehovah was obtained by adding the vowels of Adonai to the consonants of YHWH.
She burns diesel fuel at the rate of 14 litres/hour (3.7 gallons/hour) and is the most fuel efficient active vessel in the BC Ferries fleet.
Jehovah appears in Tyndale's Bible, the King James Version, and other translations from that time period and later.
In a July 2007 report prepared for the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation on traffic capacity problems over the Malahat Drive it was noted that BC Ferries' 2000 study of the "Mill Bay" service noted it was uneconomical.
For instance, Jehovah's Witnesses make consistent use of "Jehovah".
The provincial government has assured service through 2011, but BC Ferries is reported to be looking to sell service fulfillment on the route to another provider.
Many English translations of the Bible translate the Tetragrammaton as "", following the Jewish practice of substituting Adonai for it.
The fuel rebate for fares aboard the "Mill Bay" dropped from ten percent to five percent on January 25, 2010.
In the same sense as the substitution of Adonai, the Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Bible to Greek mainly used the word "Kyrios" (meaning 'lord') for YHWH.
BC Ferries refers to the route served by the "Mill Bay" as "The Island’s Most Beautiful Shortcut".
Apostle Paul was likely familiar with the use of the term Kyrios in the Septuagint and used it in his letters to refer to Jesus, thus signifying his divinity.
The news release states that the route will be closed from May 2 – 31, 2011, and will be serviced by the MV "Klitsa" beginning June 1, 2011.
The pronouncement "I Am that I Am" in Exodus 3:14, in rabbinical scholarship taken as a gloss on the meaning of the Tetragrammaton, was in Hellenistic Judaism rendered as .
In 2012, Bhavani taluk has been reorganised to form the new Anthiyur taluk.
In the iconographic tradition of Eastern Christianity, it is common to depict Christ with a cruciform halo inscribed with the letters Ο, Ω, Ν for "He Who Is".
It comes under Gobichettipalayam Revenue Division.
In Exodus 34:14, God does give his name as Jealous.
According to the 2011 census, the taluk of Bhavani had a population of 461086 with 234352 males and 226734 females.
Exodus 34:14 - For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God (1611 edition of King James Version Bible).
Walter Gramsch (born 15 January 1897, date of death unknown) worked in a high position for the State Railways in Nazi Germany, and was involved in the 20 July plot against Hitler.
While the Old Testament has a wide variety of names and epithets that refer to God in Hebrew, the Greek text of the New Testament uses far fewer variants.
He used his position to feed information to the West German Gehlen Organization.
The essential uses of the name of God the Father in the New Testament are "Theos" (θεός the Greek term for God), "Kyrios" (i.e. Lord in Greek) and "Patēr" (πατήρ i.e. Father in Greek).
In particular, he spied on Ernst Wollweber, a Soviet sabotage expert.
The Aramaic word "Abba" (אבא), meaning "Father" is used by Jesus in and also appears in Romans 8:15 and Galatians 4:6.
Gramsch was thus in a good position to report on his activities.
In the New Testament the two names Jesus and Emmanuel that refer to Jesus have salvific attributes.
This resulted in, among other things, the upset of several of Wollweber's attempts to smuggle products past the Western embargo into East Germany.
The name Jesus is given in and and in both cases the name is not selected by humans but is received by angelic messages with theological significance, e.g. the statement in Matthew 1:21 "you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save his people from their sins" associates salvific attributes to the name Jesus.
In the mid-1950s Gramsch was 'recalled' to West Germany.
Emmanuel which appears in Matthew 1:23 may refer to , and does not appear elsewhere in the New Testament, but in the context of ("I am with you always, even unto the end of the world") indicates that Jesus will be with the faithful to the end of the age.
This was to protect him from the East German SSD (coincidentally, then run by the same Wollweber he had formerly spied on) which had become recently successful in discovering and executing large numbers of spies.
According to Ulrich Luz, the Emmanuel motif brackets the entire Gospel of Matthew between 1:23 and 28:20, appearing explicitly and implicitly in several other passages, setting the tone for the salvific theme of Matthew.
It was published in 2005 by Indiana University Press.
The names of the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit are inherently related in the New Testament, e.g. with Jesus' instruction to His disciples at the end of the Gospel of Matthew :"make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit".
It has an award-winning, concomitant website entitled Oceans of Kansas Paleontology.
The Greek word "pneuma", generally translated "spirit", is found around 385 times in the New Testament.
A revised, updated, and expanded edition was published in 2017.
The English terms "Holy Spirit" and "Holy Ghost" have identical meanings, with the former having become the usual term in the 20th century.
In "Oceans of Kansas" Everhart discusses the state of the land during the Late Cretaceous and earlier, when the area was covered with water.
Three separate terms, namely "Holy Spirit", "Spirit of Truth" and "Paraclete" are used in the Johannine writings.
The geologic record shows that ancient lifeforms such as marine reptiles, pteranodons, and toothed birds inhabited the general area both in and out of the water.
The "Spirit of Truth" in used in , and .
Everhart also covers the discovery of the fossils and geographic records as well as the competition between E. D. Cope and O. C. Marsh to collect them.
The First Epistle of John then contrasts this with the "spirit of error" in .
Aplysia vaccaria, also known as the black sea hare and California black sea hare, is a species of extremely large sea slug, a marine, opisthobranch, gastropod mollusk in the family Aplysiidae.
Although in some modern cultures names are simply labels and designators that distinguish one item from another, in Christian theology the names of God have always had much deeper meaning and significance.
This sea hare species lives in the northeast Pacific Sea off California, United States and Baja California, Mexico, including the Gulf of California.
In the religious sense, the names of God are not human inventions, but have divine origin and are based on divine revelation.
The black sea hare can grow to be very large: the longest recorded specimen measured when crawling (and thus fully extended), and weighed nearly .
Veneration of the name of God goes back to the Old Testament, and as in , the Ten Commandments state: "You shall not make wrongful use of the name of the L your God".
Unlike "Aplysia californica", the body of this species is relatively firm, and the parapodia are joined behind the siphon.
Christians teachings view this commandment as not simply an avoidance of the use of the name of God, but as a directive to exalt it, through both pious deeds and praise.
Unlike many other members of the same family and genus, this species is incapable of producing ink.
In Christian teachings, the name of God is not simply a label, but involves divine mysteries that require and preempt respect and praise.
This species eats brown seaweeds and kelp, which give the animal its typically very dark coloration.
Louis Berkhof states that the issue surrounding the use and interpretation of the names of God provide a theological puzzle in that given that God is "infinite and incomprehensible", His names transcend human thought, yet they allow Him to be revealed to humans as he descends to what is finite and comprehensible.
A total of eight teams contested the league.
Thus the name of God has always been revered in the Christian tradition, and has been associated with His presence.
The regular season was played between 24 September 2009 and 14 February 2010, followed by a post-season involving the top four teams.
The traditions and the hymnody of Christian liturgy have for long emphasized the importance of acting in the name of God, e.g. the Sanctus (which may go) states: "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord".
The schedule was announced on 5 June 2009.
Going back to Church Fathers such as Cyril of Alexandria, in Christian teachings the name of God has been seen as a representation of the entire system of "divine truth" revealed to the faithful "that believe on His name" as in or "walk in the name of the Lord our God" in .
The 48 minute game switched to a 40-minute game.
This is further shown in Jesus' Farewell Discourse to His disciples at the end of the Last Supper, in which He addresses the Father and in and states:
Pre-season training began for a majority of clubs during the last week of July.
In those who bear the name of God are destined for Heaven.
A pre-season tourney, dubbed the NBL Top End Challenge, involving all eight sides was contested during August in Darwin, Northern Territory.
In Christian teachings, although the people of God bear the name of God, even they can offend the name of God by transgressing against the nature of God, and disobeying His commandments, as in : "For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you, even as it is written."
Wollongong Hawks win Top End Challenge.
Dina Jacobsen is a screenwriter, director, and actress.
The 2009–10 National Basketball League Finals played between 18 February 2010 and 12 March 2010, consisting of two best-of-three semi-finals and final series in which the higher seed hosts the first and deciding third game.
She was born in Iraq and grew up in Beirut, Lebanon.
The NBL tie-breaker system as outlined in the NBL Rules and Regulations states that in the case of a tie of three or more teams, winning percentage in games played only between those teams will determine order of finish.
She started her career as an actress on BBC's "Casualty".
Under that system, Wollongong (5-3) will finish second, Townsville (4-4) third and Gold Coast (3-5) fourth.
She wrote, directed, and starred in the feature "" (2005) which won the Viewer's Voice Award at Cinequest Film Festival in San Jose, California.
Greece took part at the Eurovision Song Contest 1992 in Malmö, Sweden, represented by Cleopatra with the song "Olou Tou Kosmou I Elpida" (Όλου του κόσμου η Ελπίδα).
White Stuff is a British fashion and lifestyle brand that sells women’s, men’s and kids' clothing, accessories, homeware and gifts in over 115 shops in the United Kingdom, shops in Germany, via mail-order catalogues and through its website.
Cleopatra was selected by Ellinikí Radiofonía Tileórasi (ERT), the Greek broadcaster, to represent the country at the contest in Sweden.
The brand has become known for its traditional British styles, idiosyncratic boutique stores and innovative marketing campaigns.
Cleopatra performed 5th on the night of the contest, following Turkey and preceding the France.
White Stuff was founded in 1985 when two friends, George Treves and Sean Thomas, decided to form a business to fund their love for skiing.
At the close of the voting the song had received 94 points, placing 5th in a field of 23.
Starting under the name “Boys from the White Stuff”, their printed T-shirts and sweatshirts became instantly popular in the alpine region of Val d'Isère.
The fifth-place in 1992 equaled the fifth-place in 1977 and it was the best place that Greece ever had until 2001.
The pair opened the first White Stuff Clothing store in London in 1991.
Ian McClelland Barker (born 21 October 1935) is an Australian barrister and Queen's Counsel.
White Stuff was founded in 1985 by two friends, George Treves and Sean Thomas.
Barker retired as a barrister in 2017.
Keen skiers, the pair decided to work together to find a way of funding their passion.
Barker was educated at Newington College (1948-1952) and the NSW Solicitors Admission Board.
They devised a business plan to sell T-shirts with abstract motifs that would appeal to skiers.
Barker is a member of the International Human Rights Observer Panel which was established in 2005 by the Law Council of Australia.
They thought up the name "Boys from the White Stuff" – a play on the title of the popular film and TV series “Boys from the Blackstuff” by Alan Bleasdale.
It is a part-time panel of Australian lawyers who serve as trial observers and undertake reviews in relation to human rights.
Sean Thomas sold the initial batch of 100 T-shirts very quickly in the company’s inaugural year, while George Treves stayed at home in the UK to work on a course at catering college.
He is regularly called upon by the national media as a commentator on matters relating to human rights and civil liberties.
The following season, they began printing sweatshirts as well as T-shirts which, according to Treves, “started to gain Alpine kudos as a grass roots level; it had an aspirational value for holidaymakers who had seen ski workers wearing it”.
A portrait of Barker, by the artist Neville Dawson, is held by the National Library of Australia.
Treves and Thomas toured the French Alpine ski resort town of Val d'Isère, selling their products in hotels and bars from a suitcase.
Corinne Louise Yorston (born 15 June 1983) is an English female international footballer who plays as a defender.
During the off-seasons, when they could not sell their garments, Treves worked as a decorator and Thomas as a driver.
She Plays for Bristol City W.F.C..
At the turn of the 21st Century, Treves and Thomas were continuing to design White Stuff’s clothing lines.
She's on loan at Oxford United W.F.C. Although primarily a left-back, who's won most of her England caps playing in central defence, she has also played as a midfielder at club level.
In February 2004 Thomas and Treves hired Sally Bailey, former Brand Director of Miss Selfridge, to help develop the brand.
She has also previously represented English Universities.
Over the next five years, Bailey moved the White Stuff label away from its original image as a winter wear retailer to begin focusing on a more bohemian, urban audience.
Yorston began her career with Southampton Saints.
Bailey stepped down from her position as CEO in 2013 and was replaced by Jeremy Seigal, formerly of Watson and The Perfume Shop.
She was inspired by Southampton coach Sue Lopez.
In 2018, Jo Jenkins, previously at Marks and Spencer joined the company as CEO.
In the 2003 close season, Yorston joined Fulham Ladies with whom she made her England debut in 2003.
By 2018, the company had grown to have more than 115 stores across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, including stores in Guernsey and Isle of Man.
Soon after this she suffered a couple of stress fractures that kept her out of the game for nearly a year.
White Stuff is also available in many House of Fraser and John Lewis stores in the UK, and in Germany as part of Karstadt.
She joined Bristol Academy in the 2005 close season, and went on to have three seasons as club captain.
The White Stuff Foundation was founded in May 2010, in celebration of the company's 25th anniversary.
She joined Arsenal Ladies in July 2009, but returned to Bristol in 2010.
Today the foundation is based in Lambeth, London.
She was loaned out to Keynsham Town to maintain fitness ahead of Bristol's FA WSL season, which began in April 2011.
White Stuff Clothing stated their aim to fulfil 25 pledges to show White Stuff's social and environmental commitments, and in particular aims at helping disadvantaged young people.
At the end of the 2014 season, Yorston left Bristol Academy to join FA WSL 2 side Yeovil Town.
The first of the White Stuff’s pledges was the creation of a charitable foundation, into which White Stuff donate 1% of their annual profits.
Yorston won 19 caps at Under-19 level and also played at Under-23 level before joining the England senior team.
Currently the White Stuff Foundation supports more than 100 small and local charities in the UK.
She made her debut, as a substitute, in the game against Germany in September 2003 and played, again as a substitute, in the game against Denmark in February 2004.
These are predominantly in the urban areas close to White Stuff's stores and distribution centres, and every branch of White Stuff is partnered with its own charity.
In May 2009, Yorston was one of the first 17 female players to be given central contracts by the Football Association.
The White Stuff Foundation also supports two charities in India and two in Denmark.
Yorston has a degree in biochemistry and graduated with a Masters from the University of Bath, where she had been awarded a Talented Athlete Scholarship.
Donations accepted by the White Stuff Foundation go towards supporting these partner charities.
After completing her Masters she began studying for an MPhil at the FA National Women's Player Development Centre at Loughborough University.
White Stuff stores are responsible for hosting their own fundraising events.
He is most famous for inventing the Savage Model 99 lever-action rifle, which remained in production for over 100 years, and founding Savage Arms.
This has led to the creation of many campaigns, including Surf Relief, Give a Gnome a Home, National Wear a Tea Cosy on Your Head Day and Charity Flip Flops, as well as local events, such as bake sales and raffles throughout each year.
However, his most lasting and valuable inventions may be radial tires, and it has been argued, the modern detachable box magazine used in almost all modern military firearms.
White Stuff stores will also sell the props used as part of their window displays at the end of every season, with proceeds going to the White Stuff Foundation.
He also invented an early torpedo and built and raced cars.
In 1991, the first White Stuff shop was opened in Clapham, London.
He was born in Kingston, Jamaica, British West Indies.
White Stuff boutiques are, according to the company website, “more than just shops, they are places where people can meet and socialise.”
His father was Welsh, a special commissioner to the West Indies, charged with setting up an educational system for the slaves emancipated in 1834.
White Stuff regularly hosts events inside its stores (including the regular White Stuff Book Club), allows customers to bring pets inside with them, and has dedicated areas for children with colouring books and dens.
In the late 1880s he took his family to Australia, homesteading in a covered wagon.
Some White Stuff stores include their own cinemas, pick ‘n’ mix counters and bespoke changing rooms decorated in themed styles.
He came to own what was then the largest cattle ranch in Australia.
White Stuff has more than 100 stores including Edinburgh, Nottingham, Manchester and Battersea.
Eleven years later he sold it and bought a coffee plantation in Jamaica.
The Curtiss Model 57 Teal was an American monoplane amphibian designed and built by the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company.
In 1892 he moved to Utica, New York, and hired himself to a railroad, the Utica Belt Line Street Railroad (See List of New York railroads).
Two versions were built, a three-seater and four-seater but only one of each was built.
He also got part-time work at a gun factory, the Utica Hammer Magazine Company.
The Teal was a monoplane amphibian with the pusher engine pod-mounted above the wing center section.
Savage and his son Arthur John began designing guns.
It was designed for the private user, but due to the economic pressures of 1930s America only one three-seater (Teal A-1 registered "N969V" ) and one four-seater (Teal B-1 registered "N970V") were built.
Six years later, he patented a lever-action rifle able to shoot then-modern guncotton military center-fire cartridges with .303-caliber spitzer bullets.
The Noctes Ambrosianae, a series of 71 imaginary colloquies, appeared in "Blackwood's Magazine" from 1822 to 1835.
Savage invented a novel rotary magazine rifle.
The earlier ones had several different authors, including John Gibson Lockhart, William Maginn, James Hogg and Professor John Wilson, but from 1825, with the 19th in the series, the contributions by Wilson predominate, and he eventually wrote all or most of 39 of the dialogues, as well as parts of some others.
A benefit of this magazine was that it had a cartridge counter on the left side of the receiver that enabled the shooter to tell how many cartridges remained in the magazine.
The scene is usually set in Ambrose's Tavern in Edinburgh, and the central characters are "Christopher North" (Wilson himself), "Timothy Tickler" (based on Robert Sym, 1750-1840, previously a Writer to the Signet), and the "Ettrick Shepherd" (based on James Hogg).
Lacking sufficient manufacturing capacity the first 9600 (plus or minus ) Model 1895 rifles were contracted to be built by Marlin Repeating Arms and are so marked with the JM proof mark.
Several other characters, imaginary or based on real people, including the "English Opium Eater" (Thomas de Quincey) and "The tailor o' Yarrow Ford" (David Brunton) occur in some episodes.
In 1894, Savage started Savage Arms in rented space on Hubbell street in Utica, New York to produce his new rifle.
The series is particularly noted for the expressive Scots dialogue of the Ettrick Shepherd.
Slightly later, in 1897, he filed for the patent on a nearly identical gun with a removable box magazine.
Fractured is the second novel in the "Atlanta" series from bestselling author Karin Slaughter.
It stayed in production until 1999.
The first book is "Triptych".
The modern removable box magazine often seen on military rifles was invented in 1908 by
This book was published in 2008.
It did not come into wide use until his patent expired in 1942 with the obvious exception of the family of rifles designed by James Paris Lee and adopted by the USN and the British Empire; first as the Lee–Metford and later as the Lee–Enfield rifles.
These books star Will Trent, a dyslexic Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent.
The box magazine has many attractive features that ensured its eventual dominance: shoulders to retain cartridges when it is removed from the rifle, operates reliably with cartridges of different lengths and is insertable and removable at any time with any number of cartridges.
The books also feature Angie Polaski and Faith Mitchell.
This allows the operator to reload the gun infrequently, carry magazines rather than loose cartridges, and to easily change the types of cartridges.
Slaughter also writes the Grant County series.
It is assembled from inexpensive stamped sheet metal.
The audiobook is narrated by Phil Gigante.
When empty the follower stops the bolt from engaging the chamber, informing the operator of the gun's emptiness before any attempt to fire.
Six months ago, Atlanta homicide detective Faith Mitchell's police captain mother was the focus of an investigation that resulted in her retirement and the firing of six narcotics officers.
Savage collaborated on the invention of the Savage-Halpine torpedo, which was eventually adopted by the Brazilian navy.
It was a righteous bust, but the cops want to protect their own, and Faith, along with the entire Atlanta police force, simmers with rage at the man responsible, GBI agent Will Trent.
Although U.S. sea trials were successful, it was not adopted in the U.S., due to political considerations.
Now Faith and Will are thrown together on a shocking murder/kidnapping case involving some of the wealthiest and most powerful families in the city, and neither one of them is happy about the pairing.
In 1901 Savage moved to Duarte, CA, and formed the Savage Tire company, a $5,000,000 San Diego, CA corporation formed to make tires and inner tubes.
But Faith gradually discovers that not only is Will not the verminous heel she expected him to be, he is a sleuth par excellence, and Will must deal with a bully from his past who is now a victim and whose irrational hostility threatens the investigation.
Here, he invented radial tires as well as new production methods.
As the case begins to center on dyslexia, Will waits nervously to see if anyone will notice his own, and he and Faith race frantically from the dormitories of Georgia Tech to the halls of one of Atlanta's exclusive private academies to keep another corpse from surfacing.
It was released as a single on February 6, 2006.
Los Aposentos is a small forested park area with a number of springs and two small lakes.
As well as the original version, the single included a number of remixes and another song by Tellier, Le Long De La Riviere Tendre.
It is located a few kilometers south of the city of Chimaltenango in Guatemala.
The song's lyrics mention "Private Rico"; this refers to the character Juan Rico from Robert A. Heinlein's book "Starship Troopers".
It was formerly known as "Finca la Alameda" and renamed to Los Aposentos in 1929.
Abel Head Pierce, known as Shanghai Pierce (June 29, 1834 – December 26, 1900) was a Texas rancher.
An area of 0.15 km², including the lakes was declared a national park in 1955.
He was born in Little Compton, Rhode Island and was a direct descendant of John Alden and Priscilla Mullins, with nine generations in between.
MV "Mill Bay" was a Canadian ferry.
He was related to Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, U.S. President Franklin Pierce, and Thomas Wentworth Pierce, builder of the Southern Pacific Railroad in Texas.
At long, it was BC Ferries' second smallest ship.
At the age of nineteen, "Shanghai" stowed away on a ship in the New York harbor.
It holds 16 vehicles (tied with the MV "Nimpkish"), 138 passengers and crew, and its maximum speed is .
He worked for his passage and arrived in Indianola, Texas, five months later without money or a job.
The "Mill Bay" operated in the Brentwood Bay-Mill Bay route across Saanich Inlet on Vancouver Island.
He went to work for W. B. Grimes as a ranch hand.
The Brentwood Bay to Mill Bay ferry started operation in November 1924 by two former naval officers, Kennaird and Williams, and it is the oldest continuous ferry service on the coast of British Columbia.
By shrewdness, hard work, and rugged determination he became an authority on cattle while working for Grimes.
Initial service by the Cascade Freight and Trading Company was provided with a 22-year-old wooden hulled coastal steamer the SS "Cascade", which was altered to allow cars to drive on or off the bow and the stern.
How Pierce acquired the name "Shanghai" is a matter of speculation.
The "Cascade" underwent many more alterations over the years, including replacement of her steam engines with internal combustion engines,
J. Frank Dobie reported that it was due to Pierce's resemblance to a banty Shanghai rooster: long-legged and short-panted.
and was eventually rechristened the "Brentwood".
Wharton County folklore holds that the name resulted from his ruthless business dealings.
Cascade Freight and Trading Company was bought by Coast Ferries Ltd. in 1945.
Pierce died on December 26, 1900.
In the 1950s the more-than-50-year-old "Brentwood" was aging and in need of replacement.
Pierce, Texas is named for him.
Coast Ferries Ltd. contracted out the construction of a new steel hulled ferry to the Victoria Machinery Depot firm in Victoria.
Ted de Corsia played Pierce in the 1957 film "Gunfight at the O.K. Corral".
On July 20, 1956 the "Mill Bay" entered service across the Saanich Inlet route and for two years both the "Mill Bay" and the older "Brentwood" both crossed the inlet while the portion of the Island Highway over the Malahat pass was being paved.
Roy Roberts was cast as Pierce in a 1957 episode of the ABC/Desilu Productions television series "The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp", with Hugh O'Brian as Wyatt Earp, then the deputy marshal of Dodge City, Kansas.
In 1969 Coast Ferries Ltd. was bought out by BC Ferries (that had formed in 1960).
Douglas Fowley guest-starred with Roberts in the episode.
Thus "Mill Bay" is a vessel four years older than the company that currently runs her and is the oldest working ferry in the BC Ferries fleet.
George Tobias played Shanghai Pierce in the episode of the television series "Laramie", starring John Smith and Robert Fuller
The Mill Bay terminal was used for a scene during the filming of the 1970 movie "Five Easy Pieces" that starred Jack Nicholson
The Rawlings Gold Glove Award, usually referred to as the Gold Glove, is the award given annually to the Major League Baseball players judged to have exhibited superior individual fielding performances at each fielding position in both the National League (NL) and the American League (AL), as voted by the managers and coaches in each league.
and Karen Black.
Managers are not permitted to vote for their own players.
On May 29, 1989 "Mill Bay" ran aground on the beach just south of the Mill Bay ferry terminal.
Eighteen Gold Gloves are awarded each year (with the exception of 1957, 1985 and 2007), one at each of the nine positions in each league.
No damage resulted and she was pulled safely back into deeper water.
In 1957, the baseball glove manufacturer Rawlings created the Gold Glove Award to commemorate the best fielding performance at each position.
The subsequent investigation discovered that the captain at the time had fallen asleep since he had just participated in the Swiftsure Yacht Race.
The award was created from a glove made from gold lamé-tanned leather and affixed to a walnut base.
On July 5, 1989 the "Mill Bay" was crossing Saanich Inlet when a problem arose with the fuel line and the engine lost power.
Initially, only one Gold Glove per position was awarded to the top fielder at each position in the entire league; however, separate awards were given for the National and American Leagues beginning in 1958.
As the ferry drifted the fuel line was repaired and the ferry eventually made it to shore under her own power.
Iván Rodríguez has won the most Gold Gloves at catcher, with 13; all were won with the Texas Rangers or the Detroit Tigers (both American League teams), though Rodríguez has played in both leagues.
In 2000 BC Ferries proposed eliminating the service provided by the "Mill Bay" but local protest was strong enough to counter the proposal and preserve the service.
Johnny Bench, who spent his entire career with the Cincinnati Reds, leads National Leaguers in wins, and is second overall with 10 Gold Gloves.
In 2001 the "Mill Bay" was removed from service for two months in the summer to undergo refurbishment that included replacement of several sections of steel plating in the hull, extension of the bridge, and the addition of radar.
Bob Boone, who is a member of one of four family pairs to win Gold Glove Awards, won seven between both leagues during his career.
In addition, the terminals in Mill Bay and Brentwood Bay were upgraded with all repairs to the terminals and vessel costing approximately $3.8 million (CAD).
Jim Sundberg has won six Gold Gloves, with Bill Freehan winning five.
The 80th anniversary of the ferry route was celebrated on November 27, 2004 at the Brentwood Bay terminal and aboard the "Mill Bay".
Hall of Famers who have won as catchers include Bench, Carlton Fisk, and Gary Carter.
On February 1, 2005 three men fell into Brentwood Bay when their canoe capsized.
The other family pair to win Gold Gloves as catchers are brothers Bengie and Yadier Molina, who have won six awards between them .
Reacting to the incident the crew aboard the "Mill Bay" picked up two of the men and the third was picked up by the Brentwood Bay Coast Guard Auxiliary.
Russell Martin set the record for putouts among winning catchers in 2007; he put out 1,065 batters for the Los Angeles Dodgers that season.
Raymond J. Parker reported in 2009 that the "Mill Bay" was used by cyclists in a significant shortcut for a Vancouver Island 300 km bike route known as "Tsunami II".
In the American League, the leader is Dan Wilson, with 1,051 putouts in 1997 though he did not win the Gold Glove Award for it.
"Mill Bay" is equipped with three lanes for cars, two with no height restriction and one lane that passes under the superstructure for the wheelhouse.
Assist leaders include Carter (108 in 1980) in the National League and the major leagues and Sundberg (103 in 1977) in the American League.
Since the trip across the inlet takes only 20 minutes "Mill Bay" does not have very many amenities.
No Gold Glove-winning catchers had posted errorless seasons until Johnson (1997) and Matheny (2003) each accomplished the feat in the National League within six years; their fielding percentages in those seasons were 1.000, and Matheny posted two other winning seasons with only one error and a .999 fielding percentage in his career.
She does have restrooms for passengers but they are not accessible to handicapped persons.
Bengie Molina leads in the American League with a one-error, .999 fielding percentage season in 2002; Sherm Lollar also posted only one error in the award's inaugural season, but a reduced number of chances left his fielding percentage at .998.
The "Mill Bay" is powered by an L. Gardner and Sons model 8L3 straight-eight engine that generates .
Johnny Edwards and Johnson hold the major league record for double plays turned among winners, with 17 each.
She burns diesel fuel at the rate of 14 litres/hour (3.7 gallons/hour) and is the most fuel efficient active vessel in the BC Ferries fleet.
Edwards doubled off 17 runners in 1964, and Johnson matched his total in 1997.
In a July 2007 report prepared for the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation on traffic capacity problems over the Malahat Drive it was noted that BC Ferries' 2000 study of the "Mill Bay" service noted it was uneconomical.
Bench holds the record for the least passed balls in a season, having allowed none in 1975.
The provincial government has assured service through 2011, but BC Ferries is reported to be looking to sell service fulfillment on the route to another provider.
Rodríguez (1999) and Boone (1988) lead the American League, with one allowed.
The fuel rebate for fares aboard the "Mill Bay" dropped from ten percent to five percent on January 25, 2010.
Rodríguez has the highest percentage of baserunners caught stealing, with a 60% mark set in 2001.
BC Ferries refers to the route served by the "Mill Bay" as "The Island’s Most Beautiful Shortcut".
Bench is the National League leader; he threw out 57% of potential base-stealers in 1969.
In a February 24, 2011 BC Ferries news release, the MV "Mill Bay" was put up for sale.
He played at representative level for England, and at club level for Batley, and Leeds (World War II guest), as a , i.e. number 11 or 12, during the era of contested scrums.
The news release states that the route will be closed from May 2 – 31, 2011, and will be serviced by the MV "Klitsa" beginning June 1, 2011.
George Brown won a cap for England while at Batley in 1945 against Wales.
The MV Klitsa now (as of summer 2016) services the Brentwood Bay - Mill Bay route.
George Brown played right-, i.e. number 12, in Leeds' 15-10 victory over Halifax in the 1942 Challenge Cup Final during the 1941–42 season at Odsal Stadium, Bradford, in front of a crowd of 15,250.
Bhavani taluk is a taluk of Erode district of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.
The media coverage of Catholic sex abuse cases is a major aspect of the academic literature surrounding the pederastic priest scandal.
The headquarters of the taluk is the town of Bhavani.
Some date the current sexual abuse scandal to an article published in the "National Catholic Reporter" in 1985.
In 2012, Bhavani taluk has been reorganised to form the new Anthiyur taluk.
After that, the scandal remained at the fringes of public attention but did not become a focus of national attention until the mid-1990s when a number of books were published on the topic.
It comes under Gobichettipalayam Revenue Division.
The topic became the focus of intense scrutiny and debate after the "Boston Globe" published a series of articles covering cases of sexual abuse.
According to the 2011 census, the taluk of Bhavani had a population of 461086 with 234352 males and 226734 females.
John L. Allen, Jr., Vatican correspondent for the "NCR", has commented that many American Catholics saw the Vatican's initial silence on the "Boston Globe" stories as evidence of a lack of concern or awareness about the issue.
There were 967 women for every 1000 men.
Allen described the Vatican's perspective as being somewhat skeptical of the media handling of the scandal.
The taluk had a literacy rate of 61.86.
In addition, he asserted that the Vatican viewed American cultural attitudes toward sexuality as being somewhat hysterical, as well as exhibiting a lack of understanding of the Catholic Church.
Child population in the age group below 6 was 19410 Males and 18204 Females.
However, it was not until early 2002 that the "Boston Globe" coverage of a series of criminal prosecutions of five Roman Catholic priests thrust the issue of sexual abuse of minors by Catholic priests into the national limelight on an ongoing basis.
After bifurcation of Anthiyur taluk, the present Bhavani taluk may have a population of 222,941 approximately.
The coverage of these cases encouraged other victims to come forward with their allegations of abuse resulting in more lawsuits and criminal cases.
Walter Gramsch (born 15 January 1897, date of death unknown) worked in a high position for the State Railways in Nazi Germany, and was involved in the 20 July plot against Hitler.
In a May 2002 interview with the Italian Catholic publication, "30 Giorni", Cardinal Oscar Maradiaga claimed that Jews influenced the "Boston Globe" to exploit the recent controversy regarding sexual abuse by Catholic priests in order to divert attention from the Israeli-Palestinian crisis.
Gramsch later became a high ranking transportation official in the Communist East German government (The GDR).
This provoked outrage from the Anti-Defamation League, especially since Maradiaga had a reputation as a moderate and was regarded as a "papabile".
However he was unhappy with the GDR and thus became a spy against it.
Before the "Boston Globe" coverage of the sexual abuse scandal in the Boston archdiocese, handling of sexual abuse allegations was largely left up to the discretion of individual bishops.
He used his position to feed information to the West German Gehlen Organization.
After the number of allegations exploded following the "Globe's" series of articles, U.S. bishops felt compelled to formulate a coordinated response at the episcopal conference level.
In particular, he spied on Ernst Wollweber, a Soviet sabotage expert.
In addition to matters regarding priests, the "Boston Globe" also reported in 2002 on matters with church staff, including a pastoral care and CCD worker, Paul Merullo, and a teenager, in Woburn, Massachusetts, which had occurred in 2000 but only made public in 2001.
After the war Wollweber became a high official in the East Germany Directorate-General of Shipping, the same area as Gramsch.
Merullo was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.
Gramsch was thus in a good position to report on his activities.
In 2003, the series of articles in the "Boston Globe" received a Pulitzer Prize for Public Service.
This resulted in, among other things, the upset of several of Wollweber's attempts to smuggle products past the Western embargo into East Germany.
"The Globe" was honored, according to the Pulitzer website, "for its courageous, comprehensive coverage ... an effort that pierced secrecy, stirred local, national and international reaction and produced changes in the Roman Catholic Church."
In the mid-1950s Gramsch was 'recalled' to West Germany.
On March 24, 2010, a report by "The New York Times" cited the Fr. Murphy case to accuse Pope Benedict XVI of a cover-up while he was head of the CDF in 1996.
This was to protect him from the East German SSD (coincidentally, then run by the same Wollweber he had formerly spied on) which had become recently successful in discovering and executing large numbers of spies.
However, Father Thomas Brundage, judicial vicar who presided at the Church's internal discipline trial of the case stated that even though his name and comments had been liberally and often inaccurately quoted in "The New York Times" and more than 100 other newspapers and on-line periodicals, he had never once been contacted by any news organization for comment.
Oceans of Kansas is a book by Michael J. Everhart.
He added that "Pope Benedict XVI has done more than any other pope or bishop in history to rid the Catholic Church of the scourge of child sexual abuse and provide for those who have been injured...on the day that Father Murphy died, he was still the defendant in a church criminal trial."
It was published in 2005 by Indiana University Press.
It was also claimed that "The New York Times" article used an incorrect translation of the document on which it based its claims.
It has an award-winning, concomitant website entitled Oceans of Kansas Paleontology.
Paolo Rodari of the Italian newspaper Il Foglio, wrote: "The computer-generated English version would support the NYT's allegations against Bertone and Ratzinger, but that same conclusion is not possible if a correct review of the sources is done."
A revised, updated, and expanded edition was published in 2017.
He added that in the official Italian text written by the CDF, it is explained that either Fr. Murphy gives ‘clear signs of repentance’ or the canonical process will go to the end, including his dismissal from the clerical state.
In "Oceans of Kansas" Everhart discusses the state of the land during the Late Cretaceous and earlier, when the area was covered with water.
But in the English version used by the NYT, not only were some passages omitted, but frequently the contrary was said.
The geologic record shows that ancient lifeforms such as marine reptiles, pteranodons, and toothed birds inhabited the general area both in and out of the water.
Director of Apologetics and Evangelization for Catholic Answers, Jimmy Akin, also pointed out, "Back in 1996 the CDF did not have a mandate to handle cases of sexual abuse by priests... The reason that Weakland notified the CDF was not because the abuse of minors was involved but because the abuse of the sacrament of confession was involved."
Everhart also covers the discovery of the fossils and geographic records as well as the competition between E. D. Cope and O. C. Marsh to collect them.
In April 2010, there were reports of a letter signed by Cardinal Ratzinger in 1985, in which he allegedly dismissed a request to laicize a Father Stephen Kiesle, a California priest accused of molesting boys.
Aplysia vaccaria, also known as the black sea hare and California black sea hare, is a species of extremely large sea slug, a marine, opisthobranch, gastropod mollusk in the family Aplysiidae.
The Vatican responded that "...the letter followed a request from the priest himself for laicization, supported by the bishop.
It is the largest sea slug species.
At this stage, Father Kiesle was already dismissed from pastoral duties during the investigation, and he had no contact with any parishioners or children."
This sea hare species lives in the northeast Pacific Sea off California, United States and Baja California, Mexico, including the Gulf of California.
The Pope's involvement with the 1985 letter has been covered in a two-part feature by the BBC.
The black sea hare can grow to be very large: the longest recorded specimen measured when crawling (and thus fully extended), and weighed nearly .
The Australian transport planning academic Paul Mees wrote, "Why did Ratzinger need to consider the request, Dawkins asks?
Unlike "Aplysia californica", the body of this species is relatively firm, and the parapodia are joined behind the siphon.
And why didn’t he report Kiesle to the police?
Unlike many other members of the same family and genus, this species is incapable of producing ink.
The answer is that Kiesle had already been reported to the police, convicted and sentenced.
All "Aplysia" species are herbivorous.
After completing his sentence, Kiesle left the priesthood and wrote to the CDF asking to be formally defrocked.
This species eats brown seaweeds and kelp, which give the animal its typically very dark coloration.
Every year, some of the church's 410,000 priests quit."
The 2009–10 NBL season was the 32nd season of competition since its establishment in 1979.
Law professor John Coverdale, in a letter to "The New York Times", wrote, "The [Laurie Goodstein] story is so wrong that it is hard to believe it is not animated by the anti-Catholic animus that the New York Times and other media outlets deny harboring... My complaint here is not that the article misuses the word "defrock" but rather that by so doing it strongly suggests to readers that Cardinal Ratzinger delayed the priest's removal from the ministry.
A total of eight teams contested the league.
Delaying laicization had nothing to do with allowing him to continue exercising the ministry, from which he had already been suspended.
The regular season was played between 24 September 2009 and 14 February 2010, followed by a post-season involving the top four teams.
Not only does the article fail to make these distinctions, it positively misstate the facts.
The schedule was announced on 5 June 2009.
Its title is "Pope Put off Move to "Punish" Abusive Priest.""
The 48 minute game switched to a 40-minute game.
According to "Crikey", "The Age" of 19 March 2010 reported that the Vienna Boys Choir "has been caught up in accusations that pedophile priests systematically abused their choristers."
Pre-season training began for a majority of clubs during the last week of July.
On the same day, "The Australian" reported that "the crisis over sexual abuse in the Catholic Church has intensified" as a result of the choir scandal.
A pre-season tourney, dubbed the NBL Top End Challenge, involving all eight sides was contested during August in Darwin, Northern Territory.
A number of books have been written about the abuse suffered from priests and nuns including Andrew Madden in "Altar Boy: A Story of Life After Abuse", Carolyn Lehman's "Strong at the Heart: How it feels to heal from sexual abuse" and the bestselling "Kathy's Story" by Kathy O'Beirne, which details physical and sexual abuse suffered in a Magdalene laundry in Ireland.
Wollongong Hawks win Top End Challenge.
Ed West of "The Daily Telegraph" claimed Kathy Beirne's story was "largely invented", according to a book by Hermann Kelly, a Derry-born "Irish Daily Mail" journalist and former editor of "The Irish Catholic".
The 2009–10 National Basketball League Finals played between 18 February 2010 and 12 March 2010, consisting of two best-of-three semi-finals and final series in which the higher seed hosts the first and deciding third game.
Matthew Robert Plummer (born 18 January 1989) is an English professional footballer who plays as a defender for AFC Mansfield in the Northern Counties East Premier Division.
The NBL tie-breaker system as outlined in the NBL Rules and Regulations states that in the case of a tie of three or more teams, winning percentage in games played only between those teams will determine order of finish.
He has previously played in the Football League for Hull City and Darlington.
Under that system, Wollongong (5-3) will finish second, Townsville (4-4) third and Gold Coast (3-5) fourth.
Plummer signed his first professional contract, a two-and-a-half-year deal, with Championship side Hull City in December 2006 after beginning his career with the club as a trainee in 1998 along with Will Atkinson, James Bennett, and Nicky Featherstone.
Greece took part at the Eurovision Song Contest 1992 in Malmö, Sweden, represented by Cleopatra with the song "Olou Tou Kosmou I Elpida" (Όλου του κόσμου η Ελπίδα).
Although the centre-back never played for Hull's senior team, he was a regular in their reserve team.
Cleopatra was selected by Ellinikí Radiofonía Tileórasi (ERT), the Greek broadcaster, to represent the country at the contest in Sweden.
His contract with Hull expired during the summer of 2009 and he subsequently left the club.
Cleopatra performed 5th on the night of the contest, following Turkey and preceding the France.
Following his departure from Hull, Plummer joined League Two side Darlington.
At the close of the voting the song had received 94 points, placing 5th in a field of 23.
Plummer made his debut for Darlington on 8 August 2009 against Aldershot coming on as a 74th-minute substitute.
The fifth-place in 1992 equaled the fifth-place in 1977 and it was the best place that Greece ever had until 2001.
He also featured against Leeds United in the League Cup, again coming off the bench.
Ian McClelland Barker (born 21 October 1935) is an Australian barrister and Queen's Counsel.
During this time, Plummer was a winner of the 'crossbar challenge' conducted by the football show "Soccer AM".
He was the first Solicitor-General of the Northern Territory and is a former president of the NSW Bar Association.
Having played eight league games, manager Steve Staunton released him from his contract along with two other first team players, David Knight, and James Bennett in December 2009.
Barker retired as a barrister in 2017.
In March 2010, Plummer joined Northern Premier League Premier Division side North Ferriby United, but left after making just one league appearance.
Barker was educated at Newington College (1948-1952) and the NSW Solicitors Admission Board.
Plummer finished the season at Central Midlands League side Westella & Willerby before signing for Northern Premier League Premier Division side FC Halifax Town ahead of season 2010–11.
Barker was the President of the NSW Bar Association in 1998-1999.
After being released by FC Halifax in November 2010, Plummer briefly joined Northern Counties East League Premier Division side Bridlington Town until signing for Northern Premier League Premier Division side Bradford Park Avenue in January 2011.
Barker is a member of the International Human Rights Observer Panel which was established in 2005 by the Law Council of Australia.
In December 2011 he signed for Northern Counties East League Premier Division side Scarborough Athletic and made eight first team appearances, starting four, before moving to Northern Premier League Division One North side Garforth Town at the end of the 2011–12 season.
It is a part-time panel of Australian lawyers who serve as trial observers and undertake reviews in relation to human rights.
He re-signed for Northern Counties East League Premier Division side Scarborough Athletic during the summer of 2012.
He is regularly called upon by the national media as a commentator on matters relating to human rights and civil liberties.
He remained at the club until 2015 when he joined Hull United.
A portrait of Barker, by the artist Neville Dawson, is held by the National Library of Australia.
In May 2016 he signed for A.F.C. Mansfield.
Corinne Louise Yorston (born 15 June 1983) is an English female international footballer who plays as a defender.
Gayakwadwada is the name of a large edifice in Pune, India which was built by the Sardar Gayakwad family as a residential place for it.
She Plays for Bristol City W.F.C..
Sayajirao Gayakwad, the prince of Baroda state, would occasionally stay there.
She's on loan at Oxford United W.F.C. Although primarily a left-back, who's won most of her England caps playing in central defence, she has also played as a midfielder at club level.
Bal Gangadhar Tilak bought the place from Sayajirao in 1905 to serve as an office building for his "Kesari" and "Maratha" newspapers.
She has also previously represented English Universities.
Tilak lived in a part of Gayakwada, and the place was occasionally used by Indian nationalists for their nightlong discussions concerning overthrow of British colonial rule over India.
Yorston began her career with Southampton Saints.
(Tilak had popularized the annual Ganesh Chaturthi festival in Pune and Maharashtra --as the means to generating nationalist spirit among people in Maharashtra—by initiating the festival in the courtyard of Gayakwadwada.)
She was inspired by Southampton coach Sue Lopez.
The edifice currently houses the offices of "Kesari" and mementos of Tilak, including his writing desk, original letters, and documents; and the first India national flag unfurled by Madame Cama.
In the 2003 close season, Yorston joined Fulham Ladies with whom she made her England debut in 2003.
The ZIP code for Secondcreek is 24974; however the post office was closed in 2010.
Soon after this she suffered a couple of stress fractures that kept her out of the game for nearly a year.
The community was named after nearby Second Creek.
She joined Bristol Academy in the 2005 close season, and went on to have three seasons as club captain.
Second Creek is an excellent trout stream although the native brook trout is in greatly reduced numbers compared to the brown trout and rainbow trout recently introduced.
She joined Arsenal Ladies in July 2009, but returned to Bristol in 2010.
Rodgers Mill is a fly fishing only site.Second Creek is stocked every April.
She was loaned out to Keynsham Town to maintain fitness ahead of Bristol's FA WSL season, which began in April 2011.
Fly anglers can access the waters using County Route 219/3 and County Route 3/7 from US Route 219.
At the end of the 2014 season, Yorston left Bristol Academy to join FA WSL 2 side Yeovil Town.
At one time in its history, more than twenty mills for powder, grist, lumbering and finishing were on this creek.
Yorston won 19 caps at Under-19 level and also played at Under-23 level before joining the England senior team.
Reed's Mill and the Nickell Homestead and Mill are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
She made her debut, as a substitute, in the game against Germany in September 2003 and played, again as a substitute, in the game against Denmark in February 2004.
John Newte (1656–1716) was a high Anglican clergyman best remembered as the defender of the lawfulness of church music.
Her next game for England was not until March 2007 when she was a substitute for Rachel Unitt in the game against Scotland.
John Newte was born at Ottery St Mary on 15 January 1656, the son of Richard Newte (1613-1678) Rector of Tidcombe and Clare.
In May 2009, Yorston was one of the first 17 female players to be given central contracts by the Football Association.
John was the grandson of Henry Newte The Elder who had been the first Town Clerk of Tiverton after that town's incorporation in 1615 (Henry was succeeded in this office by his son Henry Newte The Younger).
Yorston has a degree in biochemistry and graduated with a Masters from the University of Bath, where she had been awarded a Talented Athlete Scholarship.
He was educated at Blundell's School, and Balliol College, Oxford, where he later obtained a fellowship.
After completing her Masters she began studying for an MPhil at the FA National Women's Player Development Centre at Loughborough University.
After Oxford he was appointed Chaplain to Lord Digby, then after the Restoration Chaplain to Lord de la Warr.
Arthur William Savage (May 13, 1857 – September 22, 1938), was a businessman, inventor, and explorer.
He was appointed Chaplain to Charles II although he appears not to have served owing to his suffering gout and his residence being distant from the royal court.
He is most famous for inventing the Savage Model 99 lever-action rifle, which remained in production for over 100 years, and founding Savage Arms.
Newte championed many charitable causes: giving money for the building of St Georges Chapel, Tiverton; raising monies for the installation of an organ in St Peter's Church, Tiverton; and, leaving land to Balliol College to found an exhibition for a Blundell’s scholar in addition to having founded schools for the poor in Cove and Cullompton, Devon.
However, his most lasting and valuable inventions may be radial tires, and it has been argued, the modern detachable box magazine used in almost all modern military firearms.
The National Portrait Gallery in London holds a line engraving of Newte by Michael Van der Gucht (after Thomas Forster).
He also invented an early torpedo and built and raced cars.
Kulušić was a concert club in Zagreb, Croatia (then part of SFR Yugoslavia), which hosted many famous international acts and all the important acts from the region.
He was born in Kingston, Jamaica, British West Indies.
It is particularly associated with the Yugoslav new wave acts of the late 1970s and early 1980s.
His father was Welsh, a special commissioner to the West Indies, charged with setting up an educational system for the slaves emancipated in 1834.
Many Live albums which today are part of the ex-Yugoslav music history were recorded in Kulušić.
In the late 1880s he took his family to Australia, homesteading in a covered wagon.
Film, Bijelo dugme and Azra recorded their live albums in Kulušić in 1981, followed by Buldožer, Haustor and Leb i sol in 1982, and Ekatarina Velika and Električni orgazam in 1986.
He came to own what was then the largest cattle ranch in Australia.
Davor Gobac of Psihomodo Pop introduced his infamous stage undressing act in a 1983 gig in Kulušić.
Eleven years later he sold it and bought a coffee plantation in Jamaica.
Bajaga i Instruktori, one of the foremost Yugoslav pop-rock bands, held their very first concert in Kulušić, on April 12, 1984.
In 1892 he moved to Utica, New York, and hired himself to a railroad, the Utica Belt Line Street Railroad (See List of New York railroads).
Kulušić was a club originally run by the Youth organization and from 1987 to 1993 by Tomo in der Muhlen.
He also got part-time work at a gun factory, the Utica Hammer Magazine Company.
Mikhail Sergeyevich Rekudanov (born 5 May 1985) is a former Russian professional football player.
Savage and his son Arthur John began designing guns.
In June 2013, the Moscow police announced that he is wanted for murder.
His first model in 1887 was a lever-action rifle with the magazine in the stock, rather than under the barrel.
On 4 December 2013 he was convicted of murder and sentenced to 6 years of imprisonment.
Six years later, he patented a lever-action rifle able to shoot then-modern guncotton military center-fire cartridges with .303-caliber spitzer bullets.
According to the court, on 23 May 2013 Rekudanov stabbed a Kyrgyzstan citizen 6 times in a mass brawl on the street while under the influence of alcohol.
This "Model 95" was the direct predecessor of the Savage Model 99.
The sentence was reduced as the victim initiated the fight.
Savage invented a novel rotary magazine rifle.
Gefferson da Silva Goulart (born 9 January 1978), commonly known as Gefferson Goulart, is a Brazilian footballer.
A benefit of this magazine was that it had a cartridge counter on the left side of the receiver that enabled the shooter to tell how many cartridges remained in the magazine.
Born in São Gonçalo, Rio de Janeiro, Gefferson played with União São João in 1997.
Lacking sufficient manufacturing capacity the first 9600 (plus or minus ) Model 1895 rifles were contracted to be built by Marlin Repeating Arms and are so marked with the JM proof mark.
By 2000 he settled in Trinidad and Tobago playing with W Connection.
In 1894, Savage started Savage Arms in rented space on Hubbell street in Utica, New York to produce his new rifle.
Between January and December 2004, Gefferson and his compatriot and W Connection teammate Ronaldo Viana played on loan with Serbian side FK Železnik in the First League of Serbia and Montenegro.
Slightly later, in 1897, he filed for the patent on a nearly identical gun with a removable box magazine.
The club was performing well those years, and Gefferson got the chance to play in the 2004–05 UEFA Cup narrowly losing against Steaua by a goal difference in the overall f the two leggs.
This is substantially the modern Savage Model 99 lever-action rifle.
He also played a game in the 2004–05 Serbia and Montenegro Cup contributing for the conquest of the cup title that year.
It stayed in production until 1999.
Gefferson and Ronaldo both returned from Serbia by the end of 2004 and were included in the W Connection team for their 2005 campaign.
The modern removable box magazine often seen on military rifles was invented in 1908 by
Already before having their stint in Europe, Gefferson and Ronaldo were key-players in the 5 seasons they had spent with W Connection before 2004, and helped the club win two championships as well as several trophies.
Savage, as an improvement to the Model 99.
Further more, upon its return, Gefferson won one more TT Pro League with W Connection and also the Golden Boot and Player of the Year award in 2005.
It did not come into wide use until his patent expired in 1942 with the obvious exception of the family of rifles designed by James Paris Lee and adopted by the USN and the British Empire; first as the Lee–Metford and later as the Lee–Enfield rifles.
Blue Peter Special Assignment was a factual BBC TV series broadcast in the 1970s and early 1980s, the first spin-off from the long running BBC series "Blue Peter".
The box magazine has many attractive features that ensured its eventual dominance: shoulders to retain cartridges when it is removed from the rifle, operates reliably with cartridges of different lengths and is insertable and removable at any time with any number of cartridges.
It ran regularly from 1973 until 1981, usually at weekends on BBC1, and was heavily promoted on "Blue Peter" itself.
This allows the operator to reload the gun infrequently, carry magazines rather than loose cartridges, and to easily change the types of cartridges.
The concept for the series was developed after Valerie Singleton had presented a successful documentary 'special' with HRH Princess Anne when she had visited Kenya in 1971 (albeit narrated by Biddy Baxter).
It is assembled from inexpensive stamped sheet metal.
The Special Assignment series was mainly produced by Edward Barnes and presented initially by Valerie Singleton and later by Peter Purves and Lesley Judd both of whom had been presenters on "Blue Peter" itself.
When empty the follower stops the bolt from engaging the chamber, informing the operator of the gun's emptiness before any attempt to fire.
Series One featured Valerie Singleton looking at six European Capital Cities.
Savage collaborated on the invention of the Savage-Halpine torpedo, which was eventually adopted by the Brazilian navy.
These included Rome, Paris, London, Edinburgh, Amsterdam and Brussels.
Although U.S. sea trials were successful, it was not adopted in the U.S., due to political considerations.
The first programme to be filmed was the one featuring Rome and included a personal address to the children of Britain from Pope Paul VI in The Vatican.
In 1901 Savage moved to Duarte, CA, and formed the Savage Tire company, a $5,000,000 San Diego, CA corporation formed to make tires and inner tubes.
Series Two continued to feature Singleton looking at European Cities and included Dublin, York and Madrid.
Here, he invented radial tires as well as new production methods.
Later series looked at Islands and included The Isle of Wight, The Isle of Man, Hong Kong, Malta and Venice, even though Venice had also featured in an earlier series as a 'city'.
Savage committed suicide at the age of 81, on September 22, 1938 in San Diego, still director of his successful tire company.
Later the show began to look at famous houses or famous individuals and included biographies of Vivaldi, The Brontë Sisters, The Duke of Wellington, Saint Therese of Lisieux, Marie Antoinette and Rudyard Kipling and both Lesley Judd and Peter Purves began presenting the series in place of Singleton.
"Broadway" is a song by Sébastien Tellier from his 2004 album "Politics".
The series in 1977 was presented jointly by Peter Purves and Lesley Judd, with the theme of 'twin towns'.
It was released as a single on February 6, 2006.
The final series was co-presented alternately by Singleton and Peter Purves, being broadcast in 1981.
As well as the original version, the single included a number of remixes and another song by Tellier, Le Long De La Riviere Tendre.
The series theme was Rivers, with Singleton examining The Yukon and Niagara, while Purves reported on The Tamar, The Tweed and The Singapore Rivers.
The song's lyrics mention "Private Rico"; this refers to the character Juan Rico from Robert A. Heinlein's book "Starship Troopers".
Spin off books were published covering the first two series.
Abel Head Pierce, known as Shanghai Pierce (June 29, 1834 – December 26, 1900) was a Texas rancher.
Valerie Singleton reports on six capital cities of Europe.
He was born in Little Compton, Rhode Island and was a direct descendant of John Alden and Priscilla Mullins, with nine generations in between.
Produced by Edward Barnes.
He was related to Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, U.S. President Franklin Pierce, and Thomas Wentworth Pierce, builder of the Southern Pacific Railroad in Texas.
The series was repeated on BBC1 in November/December 1973 with the broadcast order changed to: Rome, Amsterdam, Edinburgh, Paris, City of London, Vienna.
At the age of nineteen, "Shanghai" stowed away on a ship in the New York harbor.
Valerie Singleton reports on five European cities.
He worked for his passage and arrived in Indianola, Texas, five months later without money or a job.
Produced by Edward Barnes.
He went to work for W. B. Grimes as a ranch hand.
Great names of history whose houses still exist.
By shrewdness, hard work, and rugged determination he became an authority on cattle while working for Grimes.
Produced by Edward Barnes.
How Pierce acquired the name "Shanghai" is a matter of speculation.
Peter Purves and Lesley Judd visit five different sets of twin towns.
J. Frank Dobie reported that it was due to Pierce's resemblance to a banty Shanghai rooster: long-legged and short-panted.
Produced by Edward Barnes.
Wharton County folklore holds that the name resulted from his ruthless business dealings.
Peter Purves investigates dramatic settings for the lives of six great personalities from Italy, France and England.
Pierce died on December 26, 1900.
Produced by Edward Barnes.
Pierce, Texas is named for him.
A series of five programmes produced by Edward Barnes.
Ted de Corsia played Pierce in the 1957 film "Gunfight at the O.K. Corral".
Ivica Kalinić (born 26 March 1956 in Split) is a retired Croatian football manager and former player.
Roy Roberts was cast as Pierce in a 1957 episode of the ABC/Desilu Productions television series "The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp", with Hugh O'Brian as Wyatt Earp, then the deputy marshal of Dodge City, Kansas.
He has played for Hajduk Split, Maribor, Osijek, Tirol Innsbruck and Grazer AK.
Douglas Fowley guest-starred with Roberts in the episode.
He has coached Istra Pula, Posušje, Solin, Imotski, Uskok, Mosor, Široki Brijeg, Šibenik and Hajduk Split.
George Tobias played Shanghai Pierce in the episode of the television series "Laramie", starring John Smith and Robert Fuller
Having successfully managed NK Šibenik during his two years at the club (Šibenik finished 6th in the league during the 2008-09 season), Ivica Kalinić landed the job as Hajduk Split manager after Ante Miše resigned because of a defeat against NK Zadar in August 2009.
The Rawlings Gold Glove Award, usually referred to as the Gold Glove, is the award given annually to the Major League Baseball players judged to have exhibited superior individual fielding performances at each fielding position in both the National League (NL) and the American League (AL), as voted by the managers and coaches in each league.
Kalinić managed only one game for Hajduk and that was the third round of the UEFA Europa League against MŠK Žilina on home ground.
Managers are not permitted to vote for their own players.
After Hajduk conceded a goal in the 76th minute of the game, they were losing 1-2 on aggregate.
Eighteen Gold Gloves are awarded each year (with the exception of 1957, 1985 and 2007), one at each of the nine positions in each league.
In the late minutes of the game, Kalinić suffered heart problems and was taken to the hospital.
In 1957, the baseball glove manufacturer Rawlings created the Gold Glove Award to commemorate the best fielding performance at each position.
He was clinically dead for 20 seconds and reanimated twice.
The award was created from a glove made from gold lamé-tanned leather and affixed to a walnut base.
After recovering, he retired from managing and became sporting director at Hajduk Split where he remained until his full retirement in 2012.
Initially, only one Gold Glove per position was awarded to the top fielder at each position in the entire league; however, separate awards were given for the National and American Leagues beginning in 1958.
It was completed in 1874 and opened on 1 November 1876; the reason for the delay was that the Wye Valley Railway which the branch line fed into, was not completed until the latter date.
Iván Rodríguez has won the most Gold Gloves at catcher, with 13; all were won with the Texas Rangers or the Detroit Tigers (both American League teams), though Rodríguez has played in both leagues.
It closed in 1935 when the rails buckled in the heat of the summer.
Johnny Bench, who spent his entire career with the Cincinnati Reds, leads National Leaguers in wins, and is second overall with 10 Gold Gloves.
In 1866 the Wye Valley Railway Company announced that it would not build a line through the village of Tintern, but by-pass it.
Yadier Molina is third overall and second in the NL all time with 8.
To make up for this the company was forced to build a branch to the wireworks on the other side of Tintern.
Bob Boone, who is a member of one of four family pairs to win Gold Glove Awards, won seven between both leagues during his career.
The Wye Valley Amendment Act was passed on 14 June 1875 stating that "the company would forever maintain the branch and junction in good repair"; as well as setting the regulations on running the line.
Jim Sundberg has won six Gold Gloves, with Bill Freehan winning five.
By August 1875, before the opening of the branch, the Abbey Wireworks Company had stopped trading.
There have been four 4-time winners at catcher: Del Crandall, Mike Matheny, Charles Johnson, and Tony Peña.
The line remained practically empty until the early 1880s when the works were taken over by the Abbey Wire and Tinplate Company; this venture was short lived and the works closed in 1901.
Hall of Famers who have won as catchers include Bench, Carlton Fisk, and Gary Carter.
The privately owned locomotive was sold and from then on the branch was only used by horses for the sawmills and turnery works in the village.
The other family pair to win Gold Gloves as catchers are brothers Bengie and Yadier Molina, who have won six awards between them .
The line closed in 1935.
Russell Martin set the record for putouts among winning catchers in 2007; he put out 1,065 batters for the Los Angeles Dodgers that season.
Most of the tracks were lifted in 1941 and sent for scrap.
In the American League, the leader is Dan Wilson, with 1,051 putouts in 1997 though he did not win the Gold Glove Award for it.
The junction with the Wye Valley Railway was lifted in 1945 and was the last part of the branch to be lifted.
Among Gold Glove winners, the most A.L. putouts was in 2012, when Matt Wieters had 994.
The weigh house on the line survived until the late 1970s.
Assist leaders include Carter (108 in 1980) in the National League and the major leagues and Sundberg (103 in 1977) in the American League.
Today the bridge carrying the branch over the Wye is still standing.
No Gold Glove-winning catchers had posted errorless seasons until Johnson (1997) and Matheny (2003) each accomplished the feat in the National League within six years; their fielding percentages in those seasons were 1.000, and Matheny posted two other winning seasons with only one error and a .999 fielding percentage in his career.
It now carries a public footpath.
Bengie Molina leads in the American League with a one-error, .999 fielding percentage season in 2002; Sherm Lollar also posted only one error in the award's inaugural season, but a reduced number of chances left his fielding percentage at .998.
Born in 1957 in Naila, near the northern Bavarian town of Hof, Friedrich has a PhD in law and also studied economics.
Johnny Edwards and Johnson hold the major league record for double plays turned among winners, with 17 each.
From 1990 to 1991, Friedrich worked in the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and the economy department of the Germany Embassy in Washington, D.C.
Edwards doubled off 17 runners in 1964, and Johnson matched his total in 1997.
Friedrich began his national political career as an aide to Michael Glos, a senior CSU official in parliament.
The American League leaders are Ray Fosse and Boone (16 double plays in 1971 and 1986, respectively).
He was deputy chairman of the investigating committee for party donations from 1999 until 2002 and for electoral fraud from 2002 until 2004.
Bench holds the record for the least passed balls in a season, having allowed none in 1975.
Following the 2005 federal elections, when his party joined a "Grand Coalition" with Angela Merkel as Chancellor, Friedrich became deputy chairman of the parliamentary group under the leadership of Volker Kauder, covering the portfolio of housing and development.
Rodríguez (1999) and Boone (1988) lead the American League, with one allowed.
Between 2007 and 2009, he was one of 32 members of the Second Commission on the modernization of the federal state, which had been established to reform the division of powers between federal and state authorities in Germany.
Rodríguez has the highest percentage of baserunners caught stealing, with a 60% mark set in 2001.
In the negotiations to form a coalition government following the 2009 federal elections, Friedrich led the CDU/CSU delegation in the working group on transport and building policies; his co-chair from the FDP was Patrick Döring.
Bench is the National League leader; he threw out 57% of potential base-stealers in 1969.
From 2009, Friedrich led the CSU in parliament, replacing Peter Ramsauer.
George Brown is an English former professional rugby league footballer of the 1940s.
During that time, he was said to have enjoyed a good relationship with Merkel and to have often sided with national interests over Bavarian ones.
He played at representative level for England, and at club level for Batley, and Leeds (World War II guest), as a , i.e. number 11 or 12, during the era of contested scrums.
Economic policy was widely seen as his passion as he has supported raising the retirement age to 67 despite opposition from CSU leader Horst Seehofer.
George Brown won a cap for England while at Batley in 1945 against Wales.
He also played a behind-the-scenes part in crafting Germany's response to the euro zone crisis.
George Brown played right-, i.e. number 12, in Leeds' 15-10 victory over Halifax in the 1942 Challenge Cup Final during the 1941–42 season at Odsal Stadium, Bradford, in front of a crowd of 15,250.
On 3 March 2011 Friedrich succeeded Thomas de Maizière as Federal Minister of the Interior who replaced Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg.
The media coverage of Catholic sex abuse cases is a major aspect of the academic literature surrounding the pederastic priest scandal.
The fact that Friedrich, like Guttenberg, came from the northern Bavarian area of Upper Franconia meant that his appointment ensured the regional balance of power within the CSU was maintained.
Some date the current sexual abuse scandal to an article published in the "National Catholic Reporter" in 1985.
On the occasion of the sixtieth anniversary of the diplomatic relations between German and India, Friedrich participated in the first joint cabinet meeting of the two countries’ governments in Delhi in May 2011.
After that, the scandal remained at the fringes of public attention but did not become a focus of national attention until the mid-1990s when a number of books were published on the topic.
On 7 June 2011 he attended the state dinner hosted by President Barack Obama in honor of Chancellor Angela Merkel at the White House.
The topic became the focus of intense scrutiny and debate after the "Boston Globe" published a series of articles covering cases of sexual abuse.
In early 2012, Friedrich became Chancellor Angela Merkel’s first Cabinet member to suggest Greece’s exit from the euro.
John L. Allen, Jr., Vatican correspondent for the "NCR", has commented that many American Catholics saw the Vatican's initial silence on the "Boston Globe" stories as evidence of a lack of concern or awareness about the issue.
In an interview with "Der Spiegel", he said Greece would have better chances of overhauling its economy and restoring growth if it left the euro area.
Allen described the Vatican's perspective as being somewhat skeptical of the media handling of the scandal.
In late 2012, Friedrich called for the immediate suspension of the visa-free regime for Serbia and Macedonia after more than 7,000 citizens of the two countries applied for asylum in Germany within one year.
In addition, he asserted that the Vatican viewed American cultural attitudes toward sexuality as being somewhat hysterical, as well as exhibiting a lack of understanding of the Catholic Church.
In the wake of the US National Security Agency's (NSA) internet surveillance scandal around PRISM in 2013, Friedrich was long perceived as not particularly devoted to investigating the full scope of NSA spying activities in Germany.
However, it was not until early 2002 that the "Boston Globe" coverage of a series of criminal prosecutions of five Roman Catholic priests thrust the issue of sexual abuse of minors by Catholic priests into the national limelight on an ongoing basis.
Instead, he defended the NSA's methods and promptly demanded legislation changes, in order to be able to expand surveillance of communication traffic by the German Bundesnachrichtendienst as well.
The coverage of these cases encouraged other victims to come forward with their allegations of abuse resulting in more lawsuits and criminal cases.
In an effort to point out how valuable information provided by the NSA can be for Germany, he argued that forty-five terror attacks had been prevented by the Prism program, including five in Germany; however, he soon back-peddled, unable to pinpoint the five instances.
In a May 2002 interview with the Italian Catholic publication, "30 Giorni", Cardinal Oscar Maradiaga claimed that Jews influenced the "Boston Globe" to exploit the recent controversy regarding sexual abuse by Catholic priests in order to divert attention from the Israeli-Palestinian crisis.
In a later interview with "Münchner Merkur" newspaper, Friedrich held that Edward Snowden was not a victim of political persecution.
This provoked outrage from the Anti-Defamation League, especially since Maradiaga had a reputation as a moderate and was regarded as a "papabile".
In the negotiations to form a so-called Grand Coalition following the 2013 federal elections, Friedrich led the CDU/CSU delegation in the working group on internal affairs and justice; his co-chair from the SPD was Thomas Oppermann.
Before the "Boston Globe" coverage of the sexual abuse scandal in the Boston archdiocese, handling of sexual abuse allegations was largely left up to the discretion of individual bishops.
Friedrich was sworn in as Federal Minister of Food and Agriculture in the third cabinet of Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel on 17 December 2013.
After the number of allegations exploded following the "Globe's" series of articles, U.S. bishops felt compelled to formulate a coordinated response at the episcopal conference level.
He resigned on 14 February 2014, reacting to imminent legal investigations into incidents during his tenure as Federal Minister of the Interior.
In addition to matters regarding priests, the "Boston Globe" also reported in 2002 on matters with church staff, including a pastoral care and CCD worker, Paul Merullo, and a teenager, in Woburn, Massachusetts, which had occurred in 2000 but only made public in 2001.
He is accused of betraying state secrets about legal investigations into Social Democrat Party (SPD) heads during the coalition negotiations after the federal elections in 2013.
Merullo was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.
Prosecutors complained that the leak may have compromised their inquiry.
In 2003, the series of articles in the "Boston Globe" received a Pulitzer Prize for Public Service.
The investigations showed MP Sebastian Edathy's link to a globally-operating child pornography syndicate, and plans to take up an investigation against Edathy on suspicion of possessing such material.
"The Globe" was honored, according to the Pulitzer website, "for its courageous, comprehensive coverage ... an effort that pierced secrecy, stirred local, national and international reaction and produced changes in the Roman Catholic Church."
The rock is so named for the visual effect of a "hump" it creates on the western face of the mountain.
On March 24, 2010, a report by "The New York Times" cited the Fr. Murphy case to accuse Pope Benedict XVI of a cover-up while he was head of the CDF in 1996.
Humpback Rocks, along with a well maintained trail and visitors' center, are located in the Blue Ridge Mountains near Waynesboro, Virginia in Augusta County and Nelson County.
However, Father Thomas Brundage, judicial vicar who presided at the Church's internal discipline trial of the case stated that even though his name and comments had been liberally and often inaccurately quoted in "The New York Times" and more than 100 other newspapers and on-line periodicals, he had never once been contacted by any news organization for comment.
Located six miles (10 km) south of the northern entrance to the Blue Ridge Parkway, Humpback Rocks stands out from many other mountain summits in the Blue Ridge due to its exposed rocky summit, in contrast to the heavily vegetated peaks of surrounding mountains.
He added that "Pope Benedict XVI has done more than any other pope or bishop in history to rid the Catholic Church of the scourge of child sexual abuse and provide for those who have been injured...on the day that Father Murphy died, he was still the defendant in a church criminal trial."
As is the case for most of the surrounding mountains, such as Old Rag Mountain, Humpback Rocks is underlain by an enormous granite formation, created during the Grenville Orogeny on the ocean floor about a billion years ago.
It was also claimed that "The New York Times" article used an incorrect translation of the document on which it based its claims.
About 400 million years after the Grenville Orogeny during the Catoctin Formation, basaltic magma was deposited, forming a layer of greenstone over the granite.
Paolo Rodari of the Italian newspaper Il Foglio, wrote: "The computer-generated English version would support the NYT's allegations against Bertone and Ratzinger, but that same conclusion is not possible if a correct review of the sources is done."
Over time, sand and rock sedimented on the ocean floor forming quartzite and sandstone deposits.
He added that in the official Italian text written by the CDF, it is explained that either Fr. Murphy gives ‘clear signs of repentance’ or the canonical process will go to the end, including his dismissal from the clerical state.
Finally sedimentation of shells and skeletons of foraminifera resulted in deposition of a layer of limestone.
But in the English version used by the NYT, not only were some passages omitted, but frequently the contrary was said.
Approximately 700 million years after the Grenville Oregny, the Iapetus Ocean began to close resulting in the Alleghenian Orogeny where slabs of granite and rock were transported westward and eventually thrust up over the limestone bed around it, forming Humpback Rock and the Blue Ridge Mountains.
Director of Apologetics and Evangelization for Catholic Answers, Jimmy Akin, also pointed out, "Back in 1996 the CDF did not have a mandate to handle cases of sexual abuse by priests... The reason that Weakland notified the CDF was not because the abuse of minors was involved but because the abuse of the sacrament of confession was involved."
From 1851 until the early 20th century, wagoners hauling cargo used the bygone road Howardsville Turnpike to go between Howardsville and the Shenandoah Valley.
In April 2010, there were reports of a letter signed by Cardinal Ratzinger in 1985, in which he allegedly dismissed a request to laicize a Father Stephen Kiesle, a California priest accused of molesting boys.
Often the travelers camped at Humpback Gap.
The Vatican responded that "...the letter followed a request from the priest himself for laicization, supported by the bishop.
Notable is the rock fence, reputedly built by slaves of a plantation owner, that separates the gap and Greenstone Overlook.
As such it was not a punishment, or part of a canonical process or the civil trial.
The early European settlers of the Appalachian Mountains forged a living from the native materials so abundant around them.
At this stage, Father Kiesle was already dismissed from pastoral duties during the investigation, and he had no contact with any parishioners or children."
Hickory, chestnut and oak trees provided nuts for food, logs for building and tannin for curing hides, while the rocks were put to use as foundations and chimneys for the houses and in stone fences to control wandering livestock.
The Pope's involvement with the 1985 letter has been covered in a two-part feature by the BBC.
Many self-sufficient farms sprang up in the Humpback Mountain area.
The Australian transport planning academic Paul Mees wrote, "Why did Ratzinger need to consider the request, Dawkins asks?
Today, visitors can tour a collection of 19th Century farm buildings.
And why didn’t he report Kiesle to the police?
The Mountain Farm trail provides access to the cabin and various outbuildings.
The answer is that Kiesle had already been reported to the police, convicted and sentenced.
The area also houses a visitor center with new exhibits, a picnic area, and trails.
After completing his sentence, Kiesle left the priesthood and wrote to the CDF asking to be formally defrocked.
Hiking Humpback Rocks is a relatively short hike following a trail loop.
Every year, some of the church's 410,000 priests quit."
With a roughly 45 minute hike to ascend to the peak, and a 20-25 minute descent, this ranks as one of the shorter hikes along the Blue Ridge, however it remains one of the most rewarding.
Law professor John Coverdale, in a letter to "The New York Times", wrote, "The [Laurie Goodstein] story is so wrong that it is hard to believe it is not animated by the anti-Catholic animus that the New York Times and other media outlets deny harboring... My complaint here is not that the article misuses the word "defrock" but rather that by so doing it strongly suggests to readers that Cardinal Ratzinger delayed the priest's removal from the ministry.
The peak affords a spectacular 360 degree view of the surrounding terrain.
Delaying laicization had nothing to do with allowing him to continue exercising the ministry, from which he had already been suspended.
To the north you can see into the southern section of Shenandoah National Park, to the east check out the patchwork of farms, to the southwest you see thick woods and mountain ridges of the George Washington National Forest.
Not only does the article fail to make these distinctions, it positively misstate the facts.
Hikers may continue to follow the Trail for , passing along the top of a cliff with views to the south and east before descending to a blue blaze trail.
Its title is "Pope Put off Move to "Punish" Abusive Priest.""
This trail leads into the Humpback Rocks Picnic Area.
According to "Crikey", "The Age" of 19 March 2010 reported that the Vienna Boys Choir "has been caught up in accusations that pedophile priests systematically abused their choristers."
Continuing past Humpback Rocks itself, the summit of Humpback Mountain is only a few minutes further.
On the same day, "The Australian" reported that "the crisis over sexual abuse in the Catholic Church has intensified" as a result of the choir scandal.
Coming from the north on the Appalachian Trail there is an AT shelter called The Paul C. Wolfe shelter.
A number of books have been written about the abuse suffered from priests and nuns including Andrew Madden in "Altar Boy: A Story of Life After Abuse", Carolyn Lehman's "Strong at the Heart: How it feels to heal from sexual abuse" and the bestselling "Kathy's Story" by Kathy O'Beirne, which details physical and sexual abuse suffered in a Magdalene laundry in Ireland.
The Appalachian Trail can also be accessed from the Humpback Gap parking area.
Ed West of "The Daily Telegraph" claimed Kathy Beirne's story was "largely invented", according to a book by Hermann Kelly, a Derry-born "Irish Daily Mail" journalist and former editor of "The Irish Catholic".
Southbound hikers can reach it by continuing south on the Humpback Rocks trail.
Matthew Robert Plummer (born 18 January 1989) is an English professional footballer who plays as a defender for AFC Mansfield in the Northern Counties East Premier Division.
Northbound hikers can reach it taking the one mile (1.6 km) blue blazed path at the northern end of the parking lot, or the one mile (1.6 km) white blazed path just off of the Howardsville Turnpike.
He has previously played in the Football League for Hull City and Darlington.
The word 'barnbrack' is a play on the Anglicised Irish word "Barmbrack", a type of bread that contains fruit.
Plummer signed his first professional contract, a two-and-a-half-year deal, with Championship side Hull City in December 2006 after beginning his career with the club as a trainee in 1998 along with Will Atkinson, James Bennett, and Nicky Featherstone.
Barnbrack separated in 2003, after the premature death of Quinn’s wife, Deirdre, aged 55.
Although the centre-back never played for Hull's senior team, he was a regular in their reserve team.
While Barnbrack have had many popular songs, such as "The Fly" and the "Unicorn Song", the band's only noted chart success was with a single called "Belfast", written by Lisburn-born man and band member Alex Quinn.
Plummer was also an unused substitute in Hulls’ senior games in the tie against Watford in the League Cup in 2006 and Middlesbrough in the FA Cup in 2007.
The song described the feelings felt by an expatriate, who is planning to return to Ulster and the city he left behind.
His contract with Hull expired during the summer of 2009 and he subsequently left the club.
The song was released on the Homespun label.
Following his departure from Hull, Plummer joined League Two side Darlington.
It entered the UK Singles Chart on 16 March 1985, and reached #45; it was in the chart for several weeks.
Plummer made his debut for Darlington on 8 August 2009 against Aldershot coming on as a 74th-minute substitute.
In 2009, the "Belfast Telegraph" reported that, after six years apart, the former members of the band were planning a reunion.The band is now back together and is currently touring Northern Ireland.
He also featured against Leeds United in the League Cup, again coming off the bench.
Twin Buttes Reservoir is an artificial lake located about southwest of the city of San Angelo, Texas, and immediately upstream from Lake Nasworthy.
Plummer made his full debut for Darlington on 18 August 2009 against Crewe Alexandra.
With the financial support of the Upper Colorado River Authority, construction on Twin Buttes Dam to form the reservoir was completed in 1963.
During this time, Plummer was a winner of the 'crossbar challenge' conducted by the football show "Soccer AM".
The dam is an unusual one – it dams the Middle and South Concho Rivers separately; a stabilization channel runs between the two sides of the lake.
Having played eight league games, manager Steve Staunton released him from his contract along with two other first team players, David Knight, and James Bennett in December 2009.
Water levels fell significantly during the 2010–13 Southern United States drought and remained low into 2014.
In March 2010, Plummer joined Northern Premier League Premier Division side North Ferriby United, but left after making just one league appearance.
Twin Buttes Reservoir was established to provide flood control, irrigation, water conservation, and a primary drinking water source for San Angelo and the surrounding communities in Tom Green County.
Plummer finished the season at Central Midlands League side Westella & Willerby before signing for Northern Premier League Premier Division side FC Halifax Town ahead of season 2010–11.
The lake also serves as a recreational venue for fishing, boating, and swimming.
After being released by FC Halifax in November 2010, Plummer briefly joined Northern Counties East League Premier Division side Bridlington Town until signing for Northern Premier League Premier Division side Bradford Park Avenue in January 2011.
The dam and reservoir are owned by the United States Bureau of Reclamation, and are managed by the City of San Angelo.
In December 2011 he signed for Northern Counties East League Premier Division side Scarborough Athletic and made eight first team appearances, starting four, before moving to Northern Premier League Division One North side Garforth Town at the end of the 2011–12 season.
Twin Buttes Reservoir has been stocked with species of fish intended to improve the utility of the reservoir for recreational fishing.
He re-signed for Northern Counties East League Premier Division side Scarborough Athletic during the summer of 2012.
Fish present in the lake include largemouth bass, white bass, catfish, and crappie.
He remained at the club until 2015 when he joined Hull United.
He was born in Athol, Ontario and became a physician by career.
In May 2016 he signed for A.F.C. Mansfield.
MacDiarmid graduated from McGill University where he received his medical degree (MDCM).
Gayakwadwada is the name of a large edifice in Pune, India which was built by the Sardar Gayakwad family as a residential place for it.
He was first elected to Parliament at the Glengarry riding in the 1940 general election and re-elected in 1945.
Sayajirao Gayakwad, the prince of Baroda state, would occasionally stay there.
MacDiarmid resigned on 22 June 1945 to allow William Lyon Mackenzie King to campaign for and hold the riding in a by-election after King had suffered personal defeat in the general election in his riding of Prince Albert.
Bal Gangadhar Tilak bought the place from Sayajirao in 1905 to serve as an office building for his "Kesari" and "Maratha" newspapers.
MacDiarmid died unexpectedly on 13 May 1947 at his residence in Maxville due to heart failure.
Tilak lived in a part of Gayakwada, and the place was occasionally used by Indian nationalists for their nightlong discussions concerning overthrow of British colonial rule over India.
Woolsey was the middle of three children born to Napoleon and Gertrude Woolsey.
(Tilak had popularized the annual Ganesh Chaturthi festival in Pune and Maharashtra --as the means to generating nationalist spirit among people in Maharashtra—by initiating the festival in the courtyard of Gayakwadwada.)
Woolsey was raised in Tinney Grove, Missouri, just south of the city of Braymer.
The edifice currently houses the offices of "Kesari" and mementos of Tilak, including his writing desk, original letters, and documents; and the first India national flag unfurled by Madame Cama.
He earned a medical degree from the University of Missouri and did his post-graduate work at Harvard Medical School.

He first started to sell those perfumes on a small counter in a hallway.
John Newte (1656–1716) was a high Anglican clergyman best remembered as the defender of the lawfulness of church music.
In 1946, he gained the exclusive distribution rights in Saudi Arabia of the French perfume "Ca Train De Paris".
John Newte was born at Ottery St Mary on 15 January 1656, the son of Richard Newte (1613-1678) Rector of Tidcombe and Clare.
Through the sale of exclusive perfumes, Gazzaz stores grew into a global provider of luxury goods.
John was the grandson of Henry Newte The Elder who had been the first Town Clerk of Tiverton after that town's incorporation in 1615 (Henry was succeeded in this office by his son Henry Newte The Younger).
Up until 2006, the company worked on developping its store in the country's major cities.
He was educated at Blundell's School, and Balliol College, Oxford, where he later obtained a fellowship.

He was appointed Chaplain to Charles II although he appears not to have served owing to his suffering gout and his residence being distant from the royal court.
The stores are usually 4 - 5 floors and each floor contains a specific section.
Newte championed many charitable causes: giving money for the building of St Georges Chapel, Tiverton; raising monies for the installation of an organ in St Peter's Church, Tiverton; and, leaving land to Balliol College to found an exhibition for a Blundell’s scholar in addition to having founded schools for the poor in Cove and Cullompton, Devon.

Blue Peter Special Assignment was a factual BBC TV series broadcast in the 1970s and early 1980s, the first spin-off from the long running BBC series "Blue Peter".
Amity University was established on 24 March 2005 through "The Amity University Uttar Pradesh Act, 2005 (Act 11 of 2005)" of the UP Vidhan Sabha by the Ritnand Balved Education Foundation.
It ran regularly from 1973 until 1981, usually at weekends on BBC1, and was heavily promoted on "Blue Peter" itself.
It was India's first "private" university to implement reservations based on caste etc. for both faculty as well as students.
The concept for the series was developed after Valerie Singleton had presented a successful documentary 'special' with HRH Princess Anne when she had visited Kenya in 1971 (albeit narrated by Biddy Baxter).
The school was started in 2003 with an enrollment of 120 students.
The Special Assignment series was mainly produced by Edward Barnes and presented initially by Valerie Singleton and later by Peter Purves and Lesley Judd both of whom had been presenters on "Blue Peter" itself.
In 2011, it was reported to have over 80,000 students across 240 programs.
Series One featured Valerie Singleton looking at six European Capital Cities.
In 2007, USA Today reported that Ashok Chauhan, the founder of Amity, expected that generations of his family will control the school.

Leonardo Plaza Jerusalem Hotel is a luxury hotel located in central Jerusalem on King George Street.
Produced by Edward Barnes.
Leonardo Plaza Jerusalem Hotel, overlooking Independence Park, was one of the first hotels to be built in West Jerusalem after the Six-Day War.
A series of five programmes produced by Edward Barnes.
Construction began in 1968.
Ivica Kalinić (born 26 March 1956 in Split) is a retired Croatian football manager and former player.
The architect of the 22-story Jerusalem stone-clad tower, which changed the city skyline, was Mordechai Ben-Horin.
He has played for Hajduk Split, Maribor, Osijek, Tirol Innsbruck and Grazer AK.
It opened in 1973 as the Jerusalem Plaza Hotel, operated by Canadian Pacific Hotels.
He has coached Istra Pula, Posušje, Solin, Imotski, Uskok, Mosor, Široki Brijeg, Šibenik and Hajduk Split.
It joined Sheraton Hotels in 1986 and was known as the Sheraton Jerusalem Plaza Hotel until 2008.
Having successfully managed NK Šibenik during his two years at the club (Šibenik finished 6th in the league during the 2008-09 season), Ivica Kalinić landed the job as Hajduk Split manager after Ante Miše resigned because of a defeat against NK Zadar in August 2009.
From 2008–2016, it was named the Leonardo Plaza Hotel Jerusalem.
Kalinić managed only one game for Hajduk and that was the third round of the UEFA Europa League against MŠK Žilina on home ground.
The hotel was briefly associated with Herods Hotels, part of Fattal Group, as the Herods Hotel Jerusalem.
After Hajduk conceded a goal in the 76th minute of the game, they were losing 1-2 on aggregate.
It then reverted to the Leonardo Plaza name in 2017.
In the late minutes of the game, Kalinić suffered heart problems and was taken to the hospital.
The NZR U class was a class of two 4-6-0 steam locomotives built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1904 for the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company.
He was clinically dead for 20 seconds and reanimated twice.
When that company was nationalised in 1908, they passed into the ownership of the New Zealand Railways and received the designation U.
After recovering, he retired from managing and became sporting director at Hajduk Split where he remained until his full retirement in 2012.
Weighing with a tender of , they could haul express trains easily at on mainline railways that were flat or had only a light grade.
The Tintern Wireworks Branch was a short branch line on the Wye Valley Railway.
It had coupled driving wheels, which were large for the period, a working steam pressure of , and diameter cylinders with piston strokes.
It was completed in 1874 and opened on 1 November 1876; the reason for the delay was that the Wye Valley Railway which the branch line fed into, was not completed until the latter date.
The handsome U locomotives were more than capable of making up lost time, with mile-a-minute runs recalled with pride by Manawatu railway employees.
It closed in 1935 when the rails buckled in the heat of the summer.
Although they were fast and powerful, the U locomotives were unable to survive a programme of standardisation undertaken between 1925 and 1935 to eliminate small locomotive classes that were costly to maintain in favour of large, homogeneous types that provided economies of scale.
In 1866 the Wye Valley Railway Company announced that it would not build a line through the village of Tintern, but by-pass it.
Admiral Sir Richard Lee KCB KTS (c. 1765 – 5 August 1837) was a prominent officer of the British Royal Navy who served in the American Revolutionary War, the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars.
To make up for this the company was forced to build a branch to the wireworks on the other side of Tintern.
His early career was marked by his participation in a number of important battles during the American war, during the French Revolutionary Wars he spent an unremarkable period of time in the Caribbean, but during the Napoleonic Wars he was again prominent, participating heavily in a number of important engagements.
The Wye Valley Amendment Act was passed on 14 June 1875 stating that "the company would forever maintain the branch and junction in good repair"; as well as setting the regulations on running the line.
In 1812 Lee was promoted to rear-admiral and was unable to get an appointment, his future as a serving officer in doubt.
By August 1875, before the opening of the branch, the Abbey Wireworks Company had stopped trading.
Although he never again served in an active capacity, he continued to receive promotions and rewards for his lengthy service, both from the British and Portuguese royal families.
The line remained practically empty until the early 1880s when the works were taken over by the Abbey Wire and Tinplate Company; this venture was short lived and the works closed in 1901.
He died at his home in Walmer, Kent in 1837 at the age of 72 as a full admiral.
The privately owned locomotive was sold and from then on the branch was only used by horses for the sawmills and turnery works in the village.
Richard Lee was born in approximately 1765, entering the Royal Navy at the age of just 12 as a midshipman on the sloop HMS "Speedwell", then captained by Commander John Harvey.
The line closed in 1935.
Lee later transferred to the ship of the line HMS "Triumph", which was attached to the fleet under Admiral Sir George Rodney.
Most of the tracks were lifted in 1941 and sent for scrap.
With Rodney, "Triumph" participated in the victory over the Spanish at the Battle of Cape St Vincent and the inconclusive Battle of Martinique against the French during 1780.
The junction with the Wye Valley Railway was lifted in 1945 and was the last part of the branch to be lifted.
Later in the year, Rodney's fleet sailed to New York City and "en route" seized the captured armed Jamaica ship "Lion".
The weigh house on the line survived until the late 1970s.
Lee was made master of "Lion" and cruised the coastline near Sandy Hook, on one occasion fighting a brief engagement with the American privateer "Retaliation", which was driven into Neversink.
Today the bridge carrying the branch over the Wye is still standing.
For his services, Lee was promoted to lieutenant and awarded a large financial reward from the merchants of New York.
It now carries a public footpath.
In 1781, Lee returned to Britain and joined first HMS "Recovery" and then HMS "Raisonnable", in which he participated in the relief of Gibraltar during the Great Siege.
Born in 1957 in Naila, near the northern Bavarian town of Hof, Friedrich has a PhD in law and also studied economics.
With the fleet under Lord Howe, Lee subsequently participated in the indecisive Battle of Cape Spartel.
From 1990 to 1991, Friedrich worked in the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and the economy department of the Germany Embassy in Washington, D.C.
Lee remained in service during the peace that followed, initially on HMS "Swallow" and then on the fourth rate HMS "Centurion" in the West Indies under Rear-Admiral Philip Affleck.
Friedrich began his national political career as an aide to Michael Glos, a senior CSU official in parliament.
Under Affleck's patronage, Lee received a promotion to commander in HMS "Serpent" and acted as a convoy escort during the opening months of the French Revolutionary Wars, for which service he was given substantial financial rewards by the convoy's merchants and insurers.
Friedrich has been a member of the Bundestag since the 1998 federal elections.
"Serpent" was subsequently deployed in support of allied forces during the siege of Nieuwpoort, returning in June 1794 when Lee was promoted to post captain.
He was deputy chairman of the investigating committee for party donations from 1999 until 2002 and for electoral fraud from 2002 until 2004.
Lee's first full command was HMS "Hind" in the English Channel, followed by HMS "Greyhound" in the Caribbean and the HMS "Assistance" in the Channel once more.
From 2002 until 2005 he was also judicial counselor of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group.
In 1802, Lee survived the loss of "Assistance" in a shipwreck off Dunkirk, when two hired maritime pilots grounded the vessel on a sandbar.
Following the 2005 federal elections, when his party joined a "Grand Coalition" with Angela Merkel as Chancellor, Friedrich became deputy chairman of the parliamentary group under the leadership of Volker Kauder, covering the portfolio of housing and development.
Two men were drowned in the wreck, and Lee was subsequently admonished for placing too much trust in hired pilots.
Between 2007 and 2009, he was one of 32 members of the Second Commission on the modernization of the federal state, which had been established to reform the division of powers between federal and state authorities in Germany.
The pilots were each imprisoned for six months.
In the negotiations to form a coalition government following the 2009 federal elections, Friedrich led the CDU/CSU delegation in the working group on transport and building policies; his co-chair from the FDP was Patrick Döring.
After three years unemployed, Lee returned to service in early 1805, taking over the 74-gun HMS "Courageux" and joining the squadron under Sir Richard Strachan in the Bay of Biscay.
From 2009, Friedrich led the CSU in parliament, replacing Peter Ramsauer.
On 4 November 1805, "Courgueux" was heavily engaged at the Battle of Cape Ortegal, in which four French ships of the line that had escaped from the Battle of Trafalgar were defeated and captured.
During that time, he was said to have enjoyed a good relationship with Merkel and to have often sided with national interests over Bavarian ones.
In 1806, Lee took command of HMS "Monarch", and again took part in an important action while serving with the blockade squadron under Sir Samuel Hood off Rochefort.
Economic policy was widely seen as his passion as he has supported raising the retirement age to 67 despite opposition from CSU leader Horst Seehofer.
At the Action of 25 September 1806, seven French ships attempted to break out the port for the West Indies.
He also played a behind-the-scenes part in crafting Germany's response to the euro zone crisis.
Intercepted within hours by Hood's squadron of ships of the line, the French fled, only "Monarch" managing to keep in touch.
On 3 March 2011 Friedrich succeeded Thomas de Maizière as Federal Minister of the Interior who replaced Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg.
In the ensuing engagement, four French frigates were captured although "Monarch" suffered considerable damage to her masts and rigging.
The fact that Friedrich, like Guttenberg, came from the northern Bavarian area of Upper Franconia meant that his appointment ensured the regional balance of power within the CSU was maintained.
Over the next several years, Lee was employed in the blockade of the Tagus, assisting the flight of the Portuguese Royal family in 1807 and negotiating peace with the Spanish forces in the Rio de la Plata.
On the occasion of the sixtieth anniversary of the diplomatic relations between German and India, Friedrich participated in the first joint cabinet meeting of the two countries’ governments in Delhi in May 2011.
In 1809, after his return to Britain, Lee joined the disastrous Walcheren Expedition, and remained in "Monarch" in the North Sea until 1812, when his ship was deemed no longer serviceable and broken up.
On 7 June 2011 he attended the state dinner hosted by President Barack Obama in honor of Chancellor Angela Merkel at the White House.
Advanced to rear-admiral, Lee was unable to secure a commission at sea and effectively retired from the service, although he continued to rise in rank and stature: in 1815 he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath and in 1816 was awarded the Order of the Tower and Sword by the Portuguese Royal family in recognition of her services towards them.
In early 2012, Friedrich became Chancellor Angela Merkel’s first Cabinet member to suggest Greece’s exit from the euro.
He died on 5 August 1837, at his home in Walmer, Kent.
In an interview with "Der Spiegel", he said Greece would have better chances of overhauling its economy and restoring growth if it left the euro area.
Sir James William Bulmer (1881 – 26 June 1936), also known by the nickname of "Billy", was an English professional rugby league footballer.
In late 2012, Friedrich called for the immediate suspension of the visa-free regime for Serbia and Macedonia after more than 7,000 citizens of the two countries applied for asylum in Germany within one year.
He played rugby league in the 1900s for Halifax (Heritage № 105), as a and represented England in the first ever international rugby league game in 1904.
In the wake of the US National Security Agency's (NSA) internet surveillance scandal around PRISM in 2013, Friedrich was long perceived as not particularly devoted to investigating the full scope of NSA spying activities in Germany.
Billy Bulmer was born in Halifax, West Riding of Yorkshire, during the World War I, Bulmer was a public servant, and served on the Wool Textile Control Board, and the Wool Statistical Committee.
Instead, he defended the NSA's methods and promptly demanded legislation changes, in order to be able to expand surveillance of communication traffic by the German Bundesnachrichtendienst as well.
Bulmer was knighted in 1922 as recognition for his public services.
In an effort to point out how valuable information provided by the NSA can be for Germany, he argued that forty-five terror attacks had been prevented by the Prism program, including five in Germany; however, he soon back-peddled, unable to pinpoint the five instances.
and he died aged 54 in Bradford, West Riding of Yorkshire,
In a later interview with "Münchner Merkur" newspaper, Friedrich held that Edward Snowden was not a victim of political persecution.
Bulmer won a cap playing right- for England in the 3-9 defeat by Other Nationalities at Central Park, Wigan on Tuesday 5 April 1904, in the first ever international rugby league match.
In the negotiations to form a so-called Grand Coalition following the 2013 federal elections, Friedrich led the CDU/CSU delegation in the working group on internal affairs and justice; his co-chair from the SPD was Thomas Oppermann.
"Bassia californica", "Kochia californica") is a species of flowering plant in the subfamily Camphorosmoideae of the amaranth family known by the common name rusty molly.
Friedrich was sworn in as Federal Minister of Food and Agriculture in the third cabinet of Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel on 17 December 2013.
It is native to the valleys and deserts of southeastern California and adjacent parts of Nevada, where it grows in dry, alkaline soils such as alkali flats and desert washes.
He resigned on 14 February 2014, reacting to imminent legal investigations into incidents during his tenure as Federal Minister of the Interior.
This is a perennial herb or small shrub growing one or more sprawling, branching stems to a maximum height near 60 centimeters.
He is accused of betraying state secrets about legal investigations into Social Democrat Party (SPD) heads during the coalition negotiations after the federal elections in 2013.
The stems are lined with narrow, elongated, somewhat flattened fleshy leaves up to about a centimeter long.
Prosecutors complained that the leak may have compromised their inquiry.
The leaves and stem are coated in grayish or brownish hairs.
The investigations showed MP Sebastian Edathy's link to a globally-operating child pornography syndicate, and plans to take up an investigation against Edathy on suspicion of possessing such material.
The inflorescence is made up of one or more tiny hairy flowers sprouting from the axils of the leaves.
Friedrich is married with three children.
Kunguma Chimil (English :"A Saffron Kit") is a 1985 Tamil film starring Mohan, Ilavarasi and Revathi in lead.
Humpback Rock is a massive greenstone outcrop near the peak of Humpback Mountain with a summit elevation of .
Two provincial orphans, companions, for each other in their misfortune (without money, unemployed and without place of residence), from the beginning of their first one and picturesque meeting (in the bus which brought them towards the Tamil capital), Ravi (Mogan) and Philomena (Ilavarasi) eventually fell, one thing leading to another, very loving.
The rock is so named for the visual effect of a "hump" it creates on the western face of the mountain.
He warms him his heart, with his harmonica, of a very beautiful small melody, "Nilavu Thoongum Neram ..."
Humpback Rocks, along with a well maintained trail and visitors' center, are located in the Blue Ridge Mountains near Waynesboro, Virginia in Augusta County and Nelson County.
She, practising catholic and nurse, was mistreated then threatened with death by her fatal foster home, because she surprised the man who raised her, spirit to swindle his partner in the affairs, very good and generous David (V.Gopalakrishnan).
Located six miles (10 km) south of the northern entrance to the Blue Ridge Parkway, Humpback Rocks stands out from many other mountain summits in the Blue Ridge due to its exposed rocky summit, in contrast to the heavily vegetated peaks of surrounding mountains.
The businessman was vulnerable, deprived for a moment of his view, further to an operation.
As is the case for most of the surrounding mountains, such as Old Rag Mountain, Humpback Rocks is underlain by an enormous granite formation, created during the Grenville Orogeny on the ocean floor about a billion years ago.
He was warned in time by Philomena who paid a very high price for her honesty, because in reprisals, her family decided to eliminate her.
About 400 million years after the Grenville Orogeny during the Catoctin Formation, basaltic magma was deposited, forming a layer of greenstone over the granite.
It is at this very moment that Philomena fled, so escaping her murderer and came to take refuge with the bus where was already Ravi.
Over time, sand and rock sedimented on the ocean floor forming quartzite and sandstone deposits.
Together, thus, upon their arrival in Madras, they squat successively in an old railway goods wagon, hunted by the railroad authorities, they shelter in an immense ruined and neglected building.
Finally sedimentation of shells and skeletons of foraminifera resulted in deposition of a layer of limestone.
Ravi, although awarded a diploma, find no employment in the big city.
Approximately 700 million years after the Grenville Oregny, the Iapetus Ocean began to close resulting in the Alleghenian Orogeny where slabs of granite and rock were transported westward and eventually thrust up over the limestone bed around it, forming Humpback Rock and the Blue Ridge Mountains.
He resigns to become a driver of rickshaw...
From 1851 until the early 20th century, wagoners hauling cargo used the bygone road Howardsville Turnpike to go between Howardsville and the Shenandoah Valley.
One day, Philomena comes face to face on Ravi.
Often the travelers camped at Humpback Gap.
She finds degrading that he is reduced to this job, for her, while he possesses all the qualities to obtain a more gratifying job and as high as his ambitions.
Nearby are the of Humpback Rocks Recreation Area.
It is then, contrary to all expectations, that supervisor's post releases itself in the forest region of Kargudi, but it is subjected to a condition : the deposit of a strong sum of money (10 000 rupees), by Ravi and he has only, for it, of 72 hours.
Notable is the rock fence, reputedly built by slaves of a plantation owner, that separates the gap and Greenstone Overlook.
In the meantime, the hunger torments them again...
Shortly by, at milepost 5.8, are the Humpback Rocks.
Ravi improvises in being discreetly embedded in a marriage of neighborhood, for the free food.
The early European settlers of the Appalachian Mountains forged a living from the native materials so abundant around them.
Accompanied with Philomena, together, they are surprised and thrown manu militari by the guests.
Hickory, chestnut and oak trees provided nuts for food, logs for building and tannin for curing hides, while the rocks were put to use as foundations and chimneys for the houses and in stone fences to control wandering livestock.
This sad and distressing experience makes them the terrible precariousness of their situation understand.
Many self-sufficient farms sprang up in the Humpback Mountain area.
Philomena which feels guilty, decides to part from Ravi, during six months, considering herself, a burden, a dead weight for his beloved, the time when he finds serenely a decent job.
Today, visitors can tour a collection of 19th Century farm buildings.
She promises to him to return to him after this wholesome lapse of time, in the letter which she sent him before leaving him.
The Mountain Farm trail provides access to the cabin and various outbuildings.
While being at it, Philomena, wanting to save a little girl, is knocked down by the biggest of the fates, by David's vehicle.
The area also houses a visitor center with new exhibits, a picnic area, and trails.
Whereas Ravi, aboard a bus, finds an enormous sum of money.
Hiking Humpback Rocks is a relatively short hike following a trail loop.
After careful consideration, he decides to use the money found to pay the guarantee of his future work.
With a roughly 45 minute hike to ascend to the peak, and a 20-25 minute descent, this ranks as one of the shorter hikes along the Blue Ridge, however it remains one of the most rewarding.
And there, committed, here he is left for Kargudi.
The peak affords a spectacular 360 degree view of the surrounding terrain.
Upon his arrival, he gets acquainted with a strange character, Manikkum (Delhi Ganesh) which forces to him to take the hand of his daughter.
To the north you can see into the southern section of Shenandoah National Park, to the east check out the patchwork of farms, to the southwest you see thick woods and mountain ridges of the George Washington National Forest.
The man is mentally disturbed since the marriage of his unique daughter, Rukumani (Révathi) (also called Ruku) broke off, for lack of not having been able to honor the dowry, the sum of which it lost in a bus, recently.
Hikers may continue to follow the Trail for , passing along the top of a cliff with views to the south and east before descending to a blue blaze trail.
It turns out that Ruku works for Ravi, as housewife of her house.
This trail leads into the Humpback Rocks Picnic Area.
She turns out to be very naive but especially to very awkward, causing enormous concerns to Ravi, who reprimands her severely every time.
The distance between Humpback Gap and the Humpback Rocks Picnic Area is .
In the capital, Philomena tells its setbacks to David.
A map of the hike and of the Humpback Gap Overlook is available through the Blue Ridge Parkway website.
Together, they go to meet Ravi, but on the spot, they realize that the young man is not there anymore.
Continuing past Humpback Rocks itself, the summit of Humpback Mountain is only a few minutes further.
To Kargudi, Ruku, who is a kleptomaniac also, steals the harmonica of Ravi, which afterward, remembers itself, in the solitude of the forest, with tenderness and sadness, his beloved Philomena, who does the same from her part, through their song, "Nilavu Thoongum Neram"...
The Appalachian Trail is only a short hike to the north, at milepost 6.
David has to leave to Kargudi for his business and leave only Philomena...
Camping is available nearby in the Sherando Lake Recreation Area in the George Washington National Forest off the Blue Ridge Parkway a few miles south.
The fate wants that Ravi works in the David's forest domain.
Coming from the north on the Appalachian Trail there is an AT shelter called The Paul C. Wolfe shelter.
Both men meet and appreciate mutually.
The Appalachian Trail can also be accessed from the Humpback Gap parking area.
In the passage, David recommends expressly to Ravi to take back Ruku to his service department.
Southbound hikers can reach it by continuing south on the Humpback Rocks trail.
Indeed, she was dismissed, some times previously, by Ravi, exceeded, by her clumsiness.
Northbound hikers can reach it taking the one mile (1.6 km) blue blazed path at the northern end of the parking lot, or the one mile (1.6 km) white blazed path just off of the Howardsville Turnpike.
She who came to put back to Ravi, his wallet lost a little earlier, just catches up her, while she was seriously going to flop.
Barnbrack is an Irish male vocal/instrumental folk/pop group, with band members Alex Quinn, Jimmy McPeake and Eoien McMahon.
The young woman succumbs to her rescuer.
The word 'barnbrack' is a play on the Anglicised Irish word "Barmbrack", a type of bread that contains fruit.
Sekhar, (Chandrasekhar), son of big family, who passed by Kargudi, breaks down with its car.
Barnbrack separated in 2003, after the premature death of Quinn’s wife, Deirdre, aged 55.
While he looks for some water, he meets Ruku and is in love with her in the first look.
While Barnbrack have had many popular songs, such as "The Fly" and the "Unicorn Song", the band's only noted chart success was with a single called "Belfast", written by Lisburn-born man and band member Alex Quinn.
He went to the girl's chosen by his parents, whom he gives up definitively.
The song described the feelings felt by an expatriate, who is planning to return to Ulster and the city he left behind.
On his return, he quarrels with his father who wants to disinherit him because of the refusal of the arranged marriage, Sekhar outstrips him by abandoning everything, for the beautiful eyes of Ruku and leave his cosy nest.
The song was released on the Homespun label.
Following a new thoughtlessness of Ruku, Ravi the slap in front of his father, Manikkum.
It entered the UK Singles Chart on 16 March 1985, and reached #45; it was in the chart for several weeks.
This one made sick of life, explains him his failures, in particular another time, when he lost an enormous sum of money in a bus, among others ...
In 2009, the "Belfast Telegraph" reported that, after six years apart, the former members of the band were planning a reunion.The band is now back together and is currently touring Northern Ireland.
Ravi makes the link with the sum which he found formerly, and deducts that he is bound to the misfortunes of Ruku and his father.
Twin Buttes Reservoir is an artificial lake located about southwest of the city of San Angelo, Texas, and immediately upstream from Lake Nasworthy.
He regrets bitterly his attitude past with them, in the point to express it to his boss, David.
With the financial support of the Upper Colorado River Authority, construction on Twin Buttes Dam to form the reservoir was completed in 1963.
The latter makes understand to Ravi, that he is not there, accidentally and that he could get married to Ruku, in repair, damages ...
The dam is an unusual one – it dams the Middle and South Concho Rivers separately; a stabilization channel runs between the two sides of the lake.
But Ravi answers to him that another woman waits for him (by thinking of Philomena, of course!)
Water levels fell significantly during the 2010–13 Southern United States drought and remained low into 2014.
A little later, Ruku saves in turn Ravi, of the attack of an elephant.
Twin Buttes Reservoir was established to provide flood control, irrigation, water conservation, and a primary drinking water source for San Angelo and the surrounding communities in Tom Green County.
Chased by wild animal, they take refuge at the top of a watchtower, planned for that purpose, for a whole night.
The lake also serves as a recreational venue for fishing, boating, and swimming.
It is in the early hours that the pachyderm goes away.
The dam and reservoir are owned by the United States Bureau of Reclamation, and are managed by the City of San Angelo.
Regrettably, the wrong languages already make good progress in the village further to this episode, to the point that Ravi has to get married to Ruku, avoid him the dishonor, as well as to his poor father, again.
Twin Buttes Reservoir has been stocked with species of fish intended to improve the utility of the reservoir for recreational fishing.
Thus the preparations for the marriage are thrown ...
Fish present in the lake include largemouth bass, white bass, catfish, and crappie.
From his part, Ravi understands, almost too late, also, that the person that he conversed regularly by the telephone, was not other than its Philomena, thanks to words which she, only, usually pronounced: "... Oru Bhagavad Gita-laiyo, oru Quran-laiyo, oru Bible-laiyo, ippadithan oru sambavam nadakanuna adhu maaththu yaaraalum mudiyathu!
William Burton MacDiarmid (23 May 1875 – 13 May 1947) was a Liberal party member of the House of Commons of Canada.
He warns immediately David who quite returned it, upset.
He was born in Athol, Ontario and became a physician by career.
But Ravi is always anxious to get married to Ruku, but without the presence of Philomena (who was invited at the request of David, before the rich man knows about all the affair).
MacDiarmid graduated from McGill University where he received his medical degree (MDCM).
Regrettably, Ruku who was there, hears everything.
He became a Health Officer in the communities of Maxville and Roxborough Township.
And David who had to prevent Philomena from attending the marriage, is already heading for Kargudi, his plane lands in a few hours.
He was first elected to Parliament at the Glengarry riding in the 1940 general election and re-elected in 1945.
In the car which returns her instead of the ceremony, she finds on the seat a file, forgotten the day before, by Ravi.
MacDiarmid resigned on 22 June 1945 to allow William Lyon Mackenzie King to campaign for and hold the riding in a by-election after King had suffered personal defeat in the general election in his riding of Prince Albert.
She understands while the bridegroom is other than his Ravi.
MacDiarmid died unexpectedly on 13 May 1947 at his residence in Maxville due to heart failure.
Terrified, she asks to the driver to accelerate so that he arrives in time, so that she can prevent this union between Ravi and Ruku.
Calvin Woolsey (December 26, 1883 – November 12, 1946) was an American physician and pianist.
Once there, it is with surprise that she notices that Ravi waited for her.
Woolsey was the middle of three children born to Napoleon and Gertrude Woolsey.
Indeed, Ruku decided otherwise and decided by mutual agreement, to get married, with the man who left quite behind him, for her, by love, Sekhar.
Woolsey was a descendant of George (Joris) Woolsey, one of the earliest settlers of New Amsterdam, and Thomas Cornell (settler).
Whereas now married, also, for ever, Ravi and Philomena savors every second of their common existence...
Woolsey was raised in Tinney Grove, Missouri, just south of the city of Braymer.
Music composed by Ilayaraja.
He earned a medical degree from the University of Missouri and did his post-graduate work at Harvard Medical School.
and lyrics written by Vaali and Gangaï Amaran.
He joined the Army Medical Corps during World War I and attained the rank of 1st Lieutenant.
One of the officers present during the Combatant Status Review Tribunals convened at the Guantanamo Bay detention camps, in Cuba, was known as the Recorder.
He composed rags in the folk ragtime style that was popular around 1900.
The structure of the Tribunals loosely resembled the Tribunals described in Army Regulation 190-8, with the key difference that AR-190-8 Tribunals used the definition of "combatant" consistent with that in the Geneva Conventions, while the a much broader definition of "enemy combatant" was used at Guantanamo.
He sold two of these to Jerome H. Remick and self-published several others.
As in the AR-190-8 Tribunals a panel of three officers were authorized to make a determination whether or not an individual had been properly classified as a combatant.
He also published a waltz and a march.
An additional officer was charged with the responsibility of assembling the evidence the three officers would use in making their determination, and with the responsibility to present that information to the three officers.
He died at home, in 1946, of a coronary thrombosis.
For the CSR Tribunals that officer was known as the "Recorder", and was always a military lawyer.
Gazzaz is a luxury department store based in Jeddah and with stores in locations throughout the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
CSR Tribunals added a fifth officer, the Personal Representative, whose responsibility was to meet with the captive, try to explain the CSR Tribunal process to them, learn their account of themselves, and present their account to the Tribunal if the captive chose not to attend, or proved unable to present their account themselves.
One of its stores is located on Tahlia road Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.
In the AR-190-8 Tribunal only the President was required to be a field grade officer.
The Gazzaz stores chain was founded by Hussein Bakry Gazzaz in 1942 in Mecca, after he worked shortly for the Ministry of Finance.
As they were conducted all the officers sitting on the CSR Tribunals were field grade officers.
He first started to sell those perfumes on a small counter in a hallway.
Komrij's Patentwekker ("Komrij's patented alarm clock") is a book of humorous poetry by Dutch author Gerrit Komrij, first published in 1974.
In 1946, he gained the exclusive distribution rights in Saudi Arabia of the French perfume "Ca Train De Paris".
The book contains four poems which outline a fictional invention—an alarm clock that consists of a burning candle inserted in the sleeper's anus, containing markings for each hour to be spent sleeping.
Through the sale of exclusive perfumes, Gazzaz stores grew into a global provider of luxury goods.
The deeper the candle is inserted, the earlier the sleeper rises; the inventor acquires a patent on his idea.
Up until 2006, the company worked on developping its store in the country's major cities.
They have three quatrains each, rhyming "a b a b" in pentametric lines.
In 2007, the focus shifted towads giant malls.
The poems are inspired by a suggestion in "Non Olet" by Collofino (ps.
By 2011, Gazaz operated 30 niche luxury department stores.
They were first published (apparently without the author's permission) in a series called "Amsterdamse Cahiers" by Amsterdam printer and publisher C.J. Aarts, supposedly on the occasion of the 1974 edition of Poetry International, an annual Dutch poetry festival.
The Gazzaz stores sell perfumes, make-up, jewellery and accessories - such as bags and shoes.
He later republished the poems (with the author's permission) in 1982.
They also have a section for home furniture, luxury lingerie, hair and body products.
They were included in Komrij's anthology "Alle gedichten tot gisteren" ("All the poems until yesterday").
There is a floor for men products such as shoes, wallets, pens, and other luxury products for men.
In 2007, the poems were again republished separately, with 12 black and white illustrations by Dick Matena.
The stores are usually 4 - 5 floors and each floor contains a specific section.
In 1996, 22 years after its first publication, Komrij's reading of it in Tilburg in 1996 at the annual Night of the Book festival was particularly well received.
The architectural design as well as the interior of the shops are inspired by Paris.
The poem fits in a tradition of scatological and rectal poems, many of which were collected by Komrij in his "Komrij's Cacaphonia: An Encyclopedia of Shit" (2006).
Nicola Ferrari (born 15 July 1983) is an Italian footballer who currently plays as a forward for Crema.
The poem is often associated with Komrij, and it is one of the most popular "light" Dutch poems.
Ferrari made his Serie B debut in a 4-0 win for Crotone over Piacenza on 4 September 2005.
Ellos Group is a Swedish home shopping and e-commerce company headquartered in Borås, Sweden.
Ferrari was signed by AlbinoLeffe on 4 July 2006 on a four-year contract for €550,000 transfer fee.
Ellos was founded in 1947 by Olle Blomqvist and Lars Gustafsson.
On 18 January 2010 AlbinoLeffe transferred Ferrari to Pergocrema for free.
They wanted their company to be named "LO:s," from their names, but were not allowed to register the name as LO already used it.
Ferrari was signed by Verona in summer 2010.
There is a rumour that name "Ellos" was Olle's name backwards with a genitive "s" at the end, first popularised with the widely popular Swedish talk show Hylands hörna.
In June 2012 he was provisionally suspended for 3 year due to 2011 Italian football scandal by a first level inquiry.
In 1978, the company moved to its current location in Viared, 10 km west of Borås; the new premises were inaugurated by Carl XVI Gustaf, the king of Sweden.
His case was then under review and it was announced key witnesses will be heard by the sport judges of the Appeal Court.
In 1988, the ICA concern acquired the company, which then had 1 500 employees.
After defecting, it was demonstrated that he has not committed any fault at all and he was reinstrated to Verona in January 2013.
Between 1997-2013, Ellos was a part of Redcats, which is owned by the holding company PPR.
On 17 July 2013 he went to Spezia on a temporary deal; the following year he was transferred, outright, to Modena.
Since 2013, Ellos Group is owned by the Sweden-based venture capital company Nordic Capital.
Ferrari joined Modena on 18 July 2014.
Ellos is one of Scandinavia’s leading home shopping companies with an annual turnover of more than €200 million and 620 employees.
He was assigned number 9 shirt.
Ellos Group offers two own brands, Ellos within apparel and home products and Jotex within home textile and decoration.
Fivemiletown United Football Club is an intermediate-level football club who play in the Intermediate A division of the Mid-Ulster Football League in Northern Ireland.
It has 16 tracks and was released under Sony Music Philippines.
The club is based in Fivemiletown, County Tyrone.
The song features Jeazel Grutas of the band Zelle.
The club is currently managed by Raymond Clarke.
It features Gabby Alipe of Urbandub.
The current secretary is Mike Long.
The Death of Ivan the Terrible  is a historical drama by Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy written in 1863 and first published in the January 1866 issue of "Otechestvennye zapiski" magazine.
The Reserves currently play in Fermanagh and Western Division 3.
It is the first part of a trilogy that is followed by "Tsar Fiodor Ioannovich" and concludes with "Tsar Boris".
Fivemiletown United Youth Academy provides youth teams from U9 up to U19 and have also a Youth Academy for 4 Year olds and up.
All three plays were banned by the censor.
The club's Youth teams play in the Brendan Keogh Youth League and the Mid Ulster Youth League.Long-term clubman Davy McQuigg is the club's current chairman and has served in nearly every role in the club in over 30 years involved with the club.
It dramatises the story of Ivan IV of Russia and is written in blank verse.
He was awarded a BEM (British Empire Medal) in January 2015 as part of the Queens New Years honours list for his services to youth football.
Tolstoy was influenced by the work of William Shakespeare in writing the trilogy, which formed the core of his reputation as a writer in the Russia of his day and as a dramatist to this day.
The 2014/15 season was the club's most successful season in the intermediate A section as new manager Jason Gillespie guided them to a 3rd-place finish which is the club's highest ever finish.
In the early 1863 Aleksey Tolstoy informed Yakov Polonsky in a letter from Dresden that he was working upon "a large poem in verse "The Death of Ioann Grozny"… Two acts of it are being finished and, as people tell me, are good", he added.
Fivemiletown United's most famous moment in recent years was in December 2016 when they defeated Premier Intermediate League side Dundela in the 4th Round of the Irish Cup 4-3.
The deterioration of health hindered the creative process, but Act 3 has been completed by the summer of that year and in the end of 1863 the play was virtually ready.
The first time the club had ever progressed past the Third Round.
Some details as to the original draft of it have been traced through Tolstoy's correspondence with Karolina Pavlova who was translating the text into German, and was being asked to make changes according to those Tolstoy was making to his original text.
On Thursday 24 November 2016 club chairman David McQuigg announced plans for the club to bring to an end the long serving Mini Soccer Centre and launch a brand new Academy System starting in March 2017.
Some of the scenes that have been excluded by the author from the final version of the play looked significant, one being Boris Godunov's conversation with tsarina Anastasia Romanovna about her granting him trusteeship right over Dmitry after Ioann and Fyodor's respective deaths.
Amity University, Noida is a private nonprofit research university located in Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India.
Also cut has been the scene of Godunov's talk with Dmitry's nanny.
It was established in 2005 by an Act of the State Legislature of Uttar Pradesh.The University is a part of Amity Education Group and has campuses in India, Dubai, Singapore, London, Mauritius, China and New York.
Both, according to Tolstoy, precipitated "Tsar Fiodor Ioannovich", the second play of the trilogy and both have made their way into it later, although, as critics noticed, some fragments of which exactly the same could be said, have been kept in the original text.
It is recognized by the University Grants Commission (UGC) under Section 22 of the UGC Act 1956 and accredited by the NAAC with grade 'A'.
Making preparations for the first separate edition of the play, which came in November, 1866, Tolstoy again made changes.
It is also a member of Association of Indian Universities and Association of Commonwealth Universities.
The final Zakharyin's words ("Forgive us all!
Amity University was established on 24 March 2005 through "The Amity University Uttar Pradesh Act, 2005 (Act 11 of 2005)" of the UP Vidhan Sabha by the Ritnand Balved Education Foundation.
Here's the price we have to pay for "edinovlastye", for our own corruption") also appeared for the first time in the book version, summing up what was obviously the drama’s main idea.
It was India's first "private" university to implement reservations based on caste etc. for both faculty as well as students.
Tolstoy was taking into account other people’s opinions he was becoming aware of.
The school was started in 2003 with an enrollment of 120 students.
In the Act 5 he dropped some archaisms and also several of the skomorokhs’ couplets, so as to avoid the unwanted comic effect.
In 2011, it was reported to have over 80,000 students across 240 programs.
The major source for Tolstoy as he was working upon the drama (as it was with the whole trilogy) was "History of the Russian State" by Nikolay Karamzin.
Ashok Chauhan is President of Ritnand Balved Education Foundation and Chancellor of Amity University.
The whole of the Act 1 is based upon one small fragment in Vol.IX of it describing Ioann's feelings after the killing of his son, his relinquishing the throne, boyars' reaction to this and his consent to (as he put it) "bear this burden of rule for some more time" Details of this fragment of "History" have been expanded by Tolstoy into full-blown scenes: Zakharyev addressing boyars, Ioann's musing on the possibility of taking a schema oath, his conversation with boyars.
Aseem Chauhan is the Additional President of the Foundation.
The messengerэs tale in the Scene 2, Act 1 was based upon Karamzin's description of the Pskov siege which Tolstoy has taken numerous details from, moving them together, chronologically.
In 2007, USA Today reported that Ashok Chauhan, the founder of Amity, expected that generations of his family will control the school.
The Garaburda scene (exceptionally important for the play's structure, according to the author's "Production plan") has been totally made up, but again, some details involved have been taken from Karamzin (Mikhail Garaburda's negotiations with Grozny in 1573, among others).
In September 2015, the university signed a memorandum of understanding with the BSE Institute, a subsidiary of the Bombay Stock Exchange, to commence a 2-year distance learning MBA programme in global financial markets, that will be open to students and working professionals.
Apart from Karamzin's "History" Tolstoy used, albeit to a lesser extent, "Tales of Prince Kurbsky", published in 1831 by N.Ustryalov.
In September 2016, the university purchased St. John's University's 170-acre campus in Oakdale, New York for US$22 million (£18 million).
Kurbsky's letters in Scene 2, Act 1, present a mosaic of his real letters, the 1679 one featuring most prominently.
Amity University, Noida was ranked 216 in Asia by The "QS World University Rankings" of 2018 and 171-180 among BRICS nations.
In the Act 4 the Ivan Grozny synodic text reading quotes a real document.
The "Times Higher Education World University Rankings" ranked it and 301-350 in Asia in 2018 and 251-300 in the BRICS & Emerging Economies University Rankings in 2017.
One notable exception is a Pskovian messenger, a figure featuring in historical chronicles.
The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) ranked it 65 in the overall ranking for 2018, 53 among universities, 33 in the pharmacy ranking and 48 in the management ranking.
According to Tolstoy, the action of drama takes place in 1584, the year of Ioann's death.
The Amity School Of Engineering & Technology, Noida was ranked 34 in India by the NIRF engineering ranking for 2018.
Yet, Ivan's murdering his son, the abdication, the siege of Pskov, the fire in Aleksandrovskaya sloboda all relate to the second half of 1581.
It was accredited by the National Accreditation and Assessment Council (NAAC) with grade 'A' in 2012.
Tolstoy was improvising a lot when it came to motives and undercurrents, occasionally creating links between things historians thought were unrelated.
All Amity law programs are recognised by Bar Council of India.
Having greatly increased the historical role of Boris Godunov, he's made him take part in several events had no bearing to.
A number of management programs are accredited by the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP).
According to I.Yampolsky, Boris' speech in Duma, the clash with Sitsky, addressing Tsar Ivan on behalf of Duma asking for his return to the throne, his opposition to the monarch's marrying Princess of Hastings and unwilling support for tsarina Maria, Ivan's advise for Fyodor to always listen to what Boris would say, - were all author's artistic inventions.
Amity University, Noida is the only nonprofit university in Asia to get US regional accreditation from Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC).
The idea of expanding it into a trilogy came to Tolstoy while he was working on Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich, but, as I.Yampolsky notes, "The Death of Ioann the Terrible" gives the impression some future development of Godunov's character already having been on author’s mind.
The engineering programmes of the university are also accredited by the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET).
The appearance of Mikhail Bityagovsky in the play, the figure which according to historical sources would come upon the scene many years later, could be seen as pointing to this, too.
Arikkari Ammu is a 1981 Indian Malayalam film, directed by Sreekumaran Thampi and produced by Sasikumar.
Besides, Tolstoy created new logical threads between Bityagovsky's taking part in the conflict between Boris and boyars, his agitation of people against Shuisky and Belsky - to the murder of Dmitry.
The film stars Madhu, Jayabharathi, Kuthiravattam Pappu and Suchithra Sasi in lead roles.
"The Death of Ivan the Terrible" was first performed at the Alexandrinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg in 1867.
The film featured original songs composed by V. Dakshinamoorthy.
It was not a success, due to the lead role having been given to a comic actor.
The music was composed by V. Dakshinamoorthy and lyrics was written by Sreekumaran Thampi.
The world-famous Moscow Art Theatre began its second season with a production of the play, which opened on 29 September 1899.
Orbis is the Foreign Policy Research Institute's (FPRI) quarterly journal of world affairs.
It was directed by the seminal theatre practitioner Constantin Stanislavski, who also played the lead role initially.
It was founded in 1957 by Robert Strausz-Hupé as a forum for policymakers, scholars, and the informed public who sought an engaging, thought-provoking debate beyond the predictable, conventional journals of that time.
When Stanislavski fell ill after the first few performances, he was replaced by Vsevolod Meyerhold.
Nearly half a century later, "Orbis" continues to offer informative, insightful, and lively discourse on a full range of topics relating to American foreign policy and national security, as well as in-depth analysis on important international developments.
The play received its first New York production in 1904, which opened on 1 March at the New Amsterdam Theatre on Broadway in a translation by S. R. DeMeissner.
The journal is edited by Mackubin Thomas Owens (Naval War College).
He was born on 29 July 1905 and educated at St Olave's Grammar School and the St Catharine's College, Cambridge.
Other recent editors include James Kurth (Swarthmore College, 2005–2007), David Eisenhower (University of Pennsylvania, 2001–2004), and Walter A. McDougall (University of Pennsylvania, 1995–2001).
Ordained in 1929 he began his career with a curacy at Holy Trinity, Leicester, after which he was Vice-Principal of Bishop Wilson College, Isle of Man.
[3]
From 1951 to 1966 he was Provost of Chelmsford Cathedral and Rector of Chelmsford when he was ordained to the episcopate as the Bishop of Sodor and Man, a post he held for eight years.
"Orbis" is published by Elsevier on behalf of the Foreign Policy Research Institute.
In 1974 he retired to Eynsham in Oxfordshire.
Leonardo Plaza Jerusalem Hotel is a luxury hotel located in central Jerusalem on King George Street.
He died on 6 June 1992.
The hotel is across the street from Heichal Shlomo and the Jerusalem Great Synagogue.
Thujaplicins (isopropyl cycloheptatrienolones) are series of related chemical substances discovered in the 1930s and isolated from "Thuja plicata" (western redcedar tree).
Leonardo Plaza Jerusalem Hotel, overlooking Independence Park, was one of the first hotels to be built in West Jerusalem after the Six-Day War.
They are known for potent anti-fungal and anti-bacterial properties.
Construction began in 1968.
They are also known to be potent antioxidants.
The architect of the 22-story Jerusalem stone-clad tower, which changed the city skyline, was Mordechai Ben-Horin.
"Blackfella/Whitefella" is an Australian country rock song written by Neil Murray and George Rrurrambu, recorded by their Aboriginal rock group, Warumpi Band, and released as the sole single from their 1985 album, "Big Name, No Blankets" on Parole Records and Powderworks Records.
The hotel has 279 rooms and 2 restaurants.
While not a chart success, the song drew attention to issues of racism in Australia through lyrics that encourage harmony and co-operation by people of all races.
It opened in 1973 as the Jerusalem Plaza Hotel, operated by Canadian Pacific Hotels.
The song received national airplay and attention in 1986 when politically charged rockers and Powderworks Records founders Midnight Oil accompanied the band on a free concert tour of remote Aboriginal communities as the Blackfella/Whitefella Tour.
It joined Sheraton Hotels in 1986 and was known as the Sheraton Jerusalem Plaza Hotel until 2008.
Songwriter Neil Murray's inspiration for "Blackfella/Whitefella" came from his experience as a white man working in Papunya, a predominately Indigenous community north west of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory from 1980.
From 2008–2016, it was named the Leonardo Plaza Hotel Jerusalem.
Although he was part of a minority, Murray found that in the isolated community, everybody was getting along, enjoying activities such as music and football.
The hotel was briefly associated with Herods Hotels, part of Fattal Group, as the Herods Hotel Jerusalem.
In 1985, after discussing the song and its message with band mates Sammy Butcher and George Rrurrambu, the later suggested that Murray include "yellafella" (a term sometimes used to refer to individuals of mixed race) in the lyrics, broadening the message of the song to include people from all places.
It then reverted to the Leonardo Plaza name in 2017.
In 1985 "Blackfella/Whitefella" appeared as the second track on Warumpi Band's debut album, "Big Name, No Blankets" on Parole Records and Powderworks Records.
The NZR U class was a class of two 4-6-0 steam locomotives built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1904 for the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company.
The single was included as an addition track on Australian and International 12" single releases of Midnight Oil's "The Dead Heart" released in July 1986.
When that company was nationalised in 1908, they passed into the ownership of the New Zealand Railways and received the designation U.
A 30-minute documentary film entitled "Blackfella/Whitefella" produced by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation was released in 1987.
Weighing with a tender of , they could haul express trains easily at on mainline railways that were flat or had only a light grade.
The film inspired by the song showcases both Warumpi Band and Midnight Oil while touring together through Central Australia in 1986 and deals with both music and politics.
It had coupled driving wheels, which were large for the period, a working steam pressure of , and diameter cylinders with piston strokes.
In 2012, a children's book of the same name containing the song's lyrics accompanied by illustrations by Australian children was published by One Day Hill.
The handsome U locomotives were more than capable of making up lost time, with mile-a-minute runs recalled with pride by Manawatu railway employees.
"Blackfella Whitefella" is part of a series containing the lyrics of iconic songs which are intended to educate children on the history of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and their struggle for recognition and equal rights.
Although they were fast and powerful, the U locomotives were unable to survive a programme of standardisation undertaken between 1925 and 1935 to eliminate small locomotive classes that were costly to maintain in favour of large, homogeneous types that provided economies of scale.
The book was launched by musician Archie Roach, with a percentage of book sales intended to support the Papunya community.
They were written off in 1929.
The Dull Knife Battlefield is located on the eastern slope of the Bighorn Mountains in Johnson County, Wyoming near Kaycee.
Admiral Sir Richard Lee KCB KTS (c. 1765 – 5 August 1837) was a prominent officer of the British Royal Navy who served in the American Revolutionary War, the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars.
It was the scene of the Dull Knife Fight on November 25, 1876, in which the Fourth Cavalry under General Ranald S. Mackenzie raided the winter encampment of the NorthernCheyenne, destroying most of their material culture and all their winter supplies and thus forcing the Northern Cheyenne to seek shelter with the village of Crazy Horse in order to survive the winter.
His early career was marked by his participation in a number of important battles during the American war, during the French Revolutionary Wars he spent an unremarkable period of time in the Caribbean, but during the Napoleonic Wars he was again prominent, participating heavily in a number of important engagements.
Five hundred ponies were captured and about 173 lodges destroyed.
In 1812 Lee was promoted to rear-admiral and was unable to get an appointment, his future as a serving officer in doubt.
The Dull Knife battlefield is on private land and is available to visit only by special arrangement.
Although he never again served in an active capacity, he continued to receive promotions and rewards for his lengthy service, both from the British and Portuguese royal families.
The fight took place on November 25, 1876.
He died at his home in Walmer, Kent in 1837 at the age of 72 as a full admiral.
The battlefield site was considered by the Cheyenne to be sufficiently remote to be safe as winter quarters.
Richard Lee was born in approximately 1765, entering the Royal Navy at the age of just 12 as a midshipman on the sloop HMS "Speedwell", then captained by Commander John Harvey.
The site was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.
Lee later transferred to the ship of the line HMS "Triumph", which was attached to the fleet under Admiral Sir George Rodney.
The project was announced by Emaar Properties on 23 April 2008, with opening proposed for the end of 2009.
With Rodney, "Triumph" participated in the victory over the Spanish at the Battle of Cape St Vincent and the inconclusive Battle of Martinique against the French during 1780.
The line is being built in three phases which will eventually form a 7 km loop around Downtown Dubai.
Later in the year, Rodney's fleet sailed to New York City and "en route" seized the captured armed Jamaica ship "Lion".
Phase 1 opened in 2015.
Lee was made master of "Lion" and cruised the coastline near Sandy Hook, on one occasion fighting a brief engagement with the American privateer "Retaliation", which was driven into Neversink.
It runs in the median of the orbital Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Boulevard, with three stops serving The Address and the Manzil Downtown and Vida Downtown hotels.
For his services, Lee was promoted to lieutenant and awarded a large financial reward from the merchants of New York.
Phase 1 was originally planned to be a double track express link shuttle service line operating between the Burj place interchange station with Dubai Metro and The Dubai Mall operational by end of 2009, but was put on hold in July 2010.
In 1781, Lee returned to Britain and joined first HMS "Recovery" and then HMS "Raisonnable", in which he participated in the relief of Gibraltar during the Great Siege.
Phase 2 will include the full loop, providing a single track, mono-directional clockwise commuter service operating to and from the Burj Place interchange station with Dubai Metro.
With the fleet under Lord Howe, Lee subsequently participated in the indecisive Battle of Cape Spartel.
It is expected to serve all ten stations in the network's development.
Lee remained in service during the peace that followed, initially on HMS "Swallow" and then on the fourth rate HMS "Centurion" in the West Indies under Rear-Admiral Philip Affleck.
Opening was originally planned for 2010.
Under Affleck's patronage, Lee received a promotion to commander in HMS "Serpent" and acted as a convoy escort during the opening months of the French Revolutionary Wars, for which service he was given substantial financial rewards by the convoy's merchants and insurers.
The heritage-style open-top double-decker trams built in the USA by TIG/m are powered by fuel cells, with batteries used to recover regenerated braking energy.
"Serpent" was subsequently deployed in support of allied forces during the siege of Nieuwpoort, returning in June 1794 when Lee was promoted to post captain.
Robert L. Shafer (born May 10, 1932) is an American lawyer, lobbyist, and diplomat.
Lee's first full command was HMS "Hind" in the English Channel, followed by HMS "Greyhound" in the Caribbean and the HMS "Assistance" in the Channel once more.
Mr. Shafer was born in Amery, Wisconsin and received a B.A. degree from St. John's University in Collegeville, Minnesota and a J.D. degree from Georgetown University.
In 1802, Lee survived the loss of "Assistance" in a shipwreck off Dunkirk, when two hired maritime pilots grounded the vessel on a sandbar.
Mr. Shafer was employed at Pfizer for over 30 years and was Vice-president of Public Affairs and Government Relations of the corporation when he retired in 1996.
Two men were drowned in the wreck, and Lee was subsequently admonished for placing too much trust in hired pilots.
As a representative of Pfizer, he lobbied the U.S. Congress and the governments of other countries where Pfizer had subsidiary corporations.
The pilots were each imprisoned for six months.
On June 8, 2004, Mr. Shafer succeeded Jose Antonio Linati Bosch as the Sovereign Military Order of Malta's Permanent Observer at the UN.
After three years unemployed, Lee returned to service in early 1805, taking over the 74-gun HMS "Courageux" and joining the squadron under Sir Richard Strachan in the Bay of Biscay.
Dunwoody Village is a non-profit Continuing Care Retirement Community located in Newtown Square, a western suburb of Philadelphia.
On 4 November 1805, "Courgueux" was heavily engaged at the Battle of Cape Ortegal, in which four French ships of the line that had escaped from the Battle of Trafalgar were defeated and captured.
The community is built on the grounds of an campus that has a rich history of family ownership which reaches back to the time of the American Revolution.
In 1806, Lee took command of HMS "Monarch", and again took part in an important action while serving with the blockade squadron under Sir Samuel Hood off Rochefort.
The community is named for William Hood Dunwoody.
At the Action of 25 September 1806, seven French ships attempted to break out the port for the West Indies.
It sits on land which his father James Dunwoody bought from his father-in-law, William Hood.
Intercepted within hours by Hood's squadron of ships of the line, the French fled, only "Monarch" managing to keep in touch.
Both the Hood and Dunwoody families had emigrated from England in the latter part of the 17th century.
In the ensuing engagement, four French frigates were captured although "Monarch" suffered considerable damage to her masts and rigging.
As a farm boy in the 1840s, William Dunwoody attended school at the Hood Octagonal School which still stands on the property.
Over the next several years, Lee was employed in the blockade of the Tagus, assisting the flight of the Portuguese Royal family in 1807 and negotiating peace with the Spanish forces in the Rio de la Plata.
After his schooling, Dunwoody learned to be a broker and dealer in grain from his uncle and by age 23 he formed the flour firm of Dunwoody & Robertson.
In 1809, after his return to Britain, Lee joined the disastrous Walcheren Expedition, and remained in "Monarch" in the North Sea until 1812, when his ship was deemed no longer serviceable and broken up.
In his childhood, Dunwoody had been sickly and, at the age of 28, he took his physician’s advice by moving to Minnesota where he could remain active in the grain business.
Advanced to rear-admiral, Lee was unable to secure a commission at sea and effectively retired from the service, although he continued to rise in rank and stature: in 1815 he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath and in 1816 was awarded the Order of the Tower and Sword by the Portuguese Royal family in recognition of her services towards them.
He joined Washburn-Crosby Co. in Minneapolis, a prominent milling firm that produced the highly successful Gold Medal Flour.

Sir James William Bulmer (1881 – 26 June 1936), also known by the nickname of "Billy", was an English professional rugby league footballer.
Dunwoody spent the rest of his life in Minnesota, returning to Pennsylvania annually in order to visit his parents and siblings.
He played rugby league in the 1900s for Halifax (Heritage № 105), as a and represented England in the first ever international rugby league game in 1904.
Although the family farm had been subdivided after his parents’ death, William used a part of his immense wealth to reconsolidate it for the purpose of establishing a charitable home in memory of his parents.
Billy Bulmer was born in Halifax, West Riding of Yorkshire, during the World War I, Bulmer was a public servant, and served on the Wool Textile Control Board, and the Wool Statistical Committee.

In 1924, the Dunwoody Home opened its doors to needy men and operated with a trust fund that continues to this day caring for those in need.

Bulmer won a cap playing right- for England in the 3-9 defeat by Other Nationalities at Central Park, Wigan on Tuesday 5 April 1904, in the first ever international rugby league match.
As there was no longer a pressing societal need for the services of the Dunwoody Home, utilization declined and the facilities became outdated.

On the other hand, the concept of a non-profit retirement community was evolving as a viable enterprise.
"Bassia californica", "Kochia californica") is a species of flowering plant in the subfamily Camphorosmoideae of the amaranth family known by the common name rusty molly.
The trustees of the Home sought and obtained court permission to establish a retirement village with continuing care.
It is native to the valleys and deserts of southeastern California and adjacent parts of Nevada, where it grows in dry, alkaline soils such as alkali flats and desert washes.
The trustees would oversee both the Home and the Village but the two would be separate financially and operationally.
This is a perennial herb or small shrub growing one or more sprawling, branching stems to a maximum height near 60 centimeters.
Thus Dunwoody Village came into being with its first residents arriving in late 1974.
The stems are lined with narrow, elongated, somewhat flattened fleshy leaves up to about a centimeter long.
This was early in the age of retirement villages as we know them today.
The leaves and stem are coated in grayish or brownish hairs.
As a result, the design of Dunwoody Village embraced some unique construction features seldom seen in subsequent retirement community designs.
The inflorescence is made up of one or more tiny hairy flowers sprouting from the axils of the leaves.
These include heated hallways connecting all parts of the complex, atria with natural light and growing plants spread throughout the complex, and cinder block walls to isolate noise and prevent the spread of fire.

The businessman was vulnerable, deprived for a moment of his view, further to an operation.
A large barn for farm animals built in 1924 to support the Dunwoody Home still stands.
He was warned in time by Philomena who paid a very high price for her honesty, because in reprisals, her family decided to eliminate her.
Unusual in having a glazed brick silo for fodder storage, this landmark gives a visual link to the historic nature of the property.
It is at this very moment that Philomena fled, so escaping her murderer and came to take refuge with the bus where was already Ravi.
The Hood Octagonal School building occupies a prominent position on the grounds.
Together, thus, upon their arrival in Madras, they squat successively in an old railway goods wagon, hunted by the railroad authorities, they shelter in an immense ruined and neglected building.

The Dunwoody Home itself outlived its ability to provide charitable care both financially and structurally.
He resigns to become a driver of rickshaw...
The few remaining residents were accommodated charitably in Dunwoody Village.
One day, Philomena comes face to face on Ravi.
Miller was born and raised in Portage la Prairie.
She finds degrading that he is reduced to this job, for her, while he possesses all the qualities to obtain a more gratifying job and as high as his ambitions.
He articled in the law firm of Meighen and Sexsmith, the law firm founded by future Prime Minister Arthur Meighen.
It is then, contrary to all expectations, that supervisor's post releases itself in the forest region of Kargudi, but it is subjected to a condition : the deposit of a strong sum of money (10 000 rupees), by Ravi and he has only, for it, of 72 hours.
Miller was called to the bar in 1920 and practiced law in Portage la Prairie and was respected in his field, being elected a bencher of the Law Society of Manitoba.
Ravi is distraught.
He was active with the Conservative Party of Manitoba serving as president of the provincial association.
In the meantime, the hunger torments them again...
In 1946, he was elected in a by-election to the House of Commons of Canada as the Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament for Portage la Prairie following the death of Harry Leader.
Ravi improvises in being discreetly embedded in a marriage of neighborhood, for the free food.
His riding was abolished due to redistribution and Miller did not run in another electoral district in the 1949 federal election and instead retired from politics and returned to his law practice until 1959 when he was named to the Court of Queen's Bench of Manitoba.
Accompanied with Philomena, together, they are surprised and thrown manu militari by the guests.
In 1960, he was appointed to Manitoba's Court of Appeal and in 1961 he was named Chief Justice of Manitoba.
This sad and distressing experience makes them the terrible precariousness of their situation understand.
He retired from the bench in 1967.
Philomena which feels guilty, decides to part from Ravi, during six months, considering herself, a burden, a dead weight for his beloved, the time when he finds serenely a decent job.
Phillip Paul Lloyd (born 3 March 1981) is a South African professional wrestler.
She promises to him to return to him after this wholesome lapse of time, in the letter which she sent him before leaving him.
He is currently signed to Lucha Underground under the ring name PJ Black.
While being at it, Philomena, wanting to save a little girl, is knocked down by the biggest of the fates, by David's vehicle.
A second-generation wrestler, Lloyd was initially trained by his father.
Whereas Ravi, aboard a bus, finds an enormous sum of money.
Debuting in 1997 at the age of 16, where he competed in the United Kingdom and South Africa, and was the inaugural winner of the WWP World Cruiserweight Championship in World Wrestling Professionals as PJ Black.
After careful consideration, he decides to use the money found to pay the guarantee of his future work.
In 2008, Lloyd signed a developmental contract with World Wrestling Entertainment, and was assigned to Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), WWE's developmental territory, where he won the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship, with Kris Logan, and the FCW Florida Heavyweight Championship.
And there, committed, here he is left for Kargudi.
In February 2010, he competed in the first season of "NXT", finishing third, before being called to the main roster in June 2010 joining The Nexus.
Upon his arrival, he gets acquainted with a strange character, Manikkum (Delhi Ganesh) which forces to him to take the hand of his daughter.
He joined The Corre in 2011.
The man is mentally disturbed since the marriage of his unique daughter, Rukumani (Révathi) (also called Ruku) broke off, for lack of not having been able to honor the dowry, the sum of which it lost in a bus, recently.
Teaming regularly with Heath Slater, the duo won the WWE Tag Team Championship three times in 2010 and 2011, which was the apex of Gabriel's success with WWE.
It turns out that Ruku works for Ravi, as housewife of her house.
He also won the TNA King of the Mountain Championship during his brief GFW crossover appearances with TNA in 2015.
She turns out to be very naive but especially to very awkward, causing enormous concerns to Ravi, who reprimands her severely every time.
Lloyd was originally trained by his father, a promoter and wrestler in South Africa, who was also known by his ring name The Pink Panther.
In the capital, Philomena tells its setbacks to David.
Lloyd grew up watching his father wrestle and in the early part of his training he used to practice in the backyard of his home, in which two rings were positioned.
Together, they go to meet Ravi, but on the spot, they realize that the young man is not there anymore.
Using the ring name "PJ Black", he formed a regular tag team with Ray Leppan called Pure Juice.
To Kargudi, Ruku, who is a kleptomaniac also, steals the harmonica of Ravi, which afterward, remembers itself, in the solitude of the forest, with tenderness and sadness, his beloved Philomena, who does the same from her part, through their song, "Nilavu Thoongum Neram"...
His father was shot and killed in front of him during Lloyd's final year in high school, and a year later he moved to the United Kingdom for five years.
David has to leave to Kargudi for his business and leave only Philomena...
Lloyd spent five years in the United Kingdom, where he trained with Frontier Wrestling Alliance.
The fate wants that Ravi works in the David's forest domain.
He was trained by Alex Shane and Mark Sloan.
Both men meet and appreciate mutually.
He debuted for the South African promotion World Wrestling Professionals (WWP) in 2005.
In the passage, David recommends expressly to Ravi to take back Ruku to his service department.
In 2006, he returned to South Africa full-time, and returned to WWP.
Indeed, she was dismissed, some times previously, by Ravi, exceeded, by her clumsiness.
On 1 November 2007, Black became the promotion's inaugural World Cruiserweight Champion, by defeating The Playa in a match to determine the inaugural champion.
She who came to put back to Ravi, his wallet lost a little earlier, just catches up her, while she was seriously going to flop.
After holding the championship for 13 days, he lost it to Lizzard on 14 November.
The young woman succumbs to her rescuer.
He then declared his intentions to compete in WWP's heavyweight division.
Sekhar, (Chandrasekhar), son of big family, who passed by Kargudi, breaks down with its car.
Lloyd challenged unsuccessfully for the WWP World Heavyweight Championship against Joe E Legend on a "WWP Thunderstrike" episode that aired on 10 January 2009.
While he looks for some water, he meets Ruku and is in love with her in the first look.
During the match he suffered minor burns to the face after a fireball spot did not go as originally planned, and he had to be treated in hospital.
He went to the girl's chosen by his parents, whom he gives up definitively.
His final match in South Africa took place on 8 November 2008 at WWP's bi-annual Carnival City Casino show, where he was defeated by Terri Middoux in front of a record attendance.
On his return, he quarrels with his father who wants to disinherit him because of the refusal of the arranged marriage, Sekhar outstrips him by abandoning everything, for the beautiful eyes of Ruku and leave his cosy nest.
In 2008, Lloyd signed a three-year developmental deal with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), becoming the first South African person to do so.
Following a new thoughtlessness of Ruku, Ravi the slap in front of his father, Manikkum.
He was assigned to Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), WWE's developmental territory, where he made his debut under his real name on 5 February, in a loss to Kawal.
This one made sick of life, explains him his failures, in particular another time, when he lost an enormous sum of money in a bus, among others ...
His first win in FCW came the following week, when he teamed with Caylen Croft and Trent Barreta to defeat Tyler Reks, Johnny Curtis, and DJ Gabriel in a six-man tag team match.
Ravi makes the link with the sum which he found formerly, and deducts that he is bound to the misfortunes of Ruku and his father.
The following month, he changed his ring name to 'Justin Angel'.
He regrets bitterly his attitude past with them, in the point to express it to his boss, David.
He went on to wrestle against DH Smith, Barreta, Yoshitatsu, and Lance Hoyt over the next few months.
The latter makes understand to Ravi, that he is not there, accidentally and that he could get married to Ruku, in repair, damages ...
In June, he formed a tag team with Kris Logan, with the pair defeating DJ Gabriel and Vic Adams in their debut match as a team.
But Ravi answers to him that another woman waits for him (by thinking of Philomena, of course!)
They quickly began to feud with The Dude Busters of Barreta and Croft, losing to them in several championship matches over the next month.
A little later, Ruku saves in turn Ravi, of the attack of an elephant.
At the 23 July 2009 tapings of FCW's television show, Angel and Logan defeated Barreta and Croft to become the Florida Tag Team Champions.
Chased by wild animal, they take refuge at the top of a watchtower, planned for that purpose, for a whole night.
They lost the championship on the same night to The Rotundos (Bo and Duke).
It is in the early hours that the pachyderm goes away.
Following the loss of the championship, Angel and Logan dissolved as a tag team, with Angel returning to singles competition.
Regrettably, the wrong languages already make good progress in the village further to this episode, to the point that Ravi has to get married to Ruku, avoid him the dishonor, as well as to his poor father, again.
He went on a winning streak throughout August, defeating Alex Riley, Vance Archer, and Sheamus.
Thus the preparations for the marriage are thrown ...
Angel won the Florida Heavyweight Championship from Heath Slater in a two out of three falls match at the 24 September 2009 television tapings.
Sekhar sends to Rukku the congratulations of circumstances, with a lot of bitterness.
He successfully defended the championship against Drew McIntyre, Eric Escobar, Slater, and Curt Hawkins throughout late 2009.
From his part, Ravi understands, almost too late, also, that the person that he conversed regularly by the telephone, was not other than its Philomena, thanks to words which she, only, usually pronounced: "... Oru Bhagavad Gita-laiyo, oru Quran-laiyo, oru Bible-laiyo, ippadithan oru sambavam nadakanuna adhu maaththu yaaraalum mudiyathu!
In February 2010, he changed his ring name to 'Justin Gabriel' to coincide with his appearances on "NXT".
..."
Further successful championship defenses occurred in early 2010, against competitors including Hawkins, Barreta, and Kaval.
He warns immediately David who quite returned it, upset.
After a near six-month reign, Gabriel lost the championship at the 18 March television tapings, when Alex Riley won a three-way match, which also included Wade Barrett.
But Ravi is always anxious to get married to Ruku, but without the presence of Philomena (who was invited at the request of David, before the rich man knows about all the affair).
Gabriel lost a rematch to Riley on 31 March and again on 20 May.
Regrettably, Ruku who was there, hears everything.
In May, he started a feud with fellow South African Leo Kruger over who was the better wrestler.
And David who had to prevent Philomena from attending the marriage, is already heading for Kargudi, his plane lands in a few hours.
On 10 June, Gabriel beat Kruger, but Kruger reversed the result in a rematch at the 1 July television tapings, which was Gabriel's final appearance in FCW.
In the car which returns her instead of the ceremony, she finds on the seat a file, forgotten the day before, by Ravi.
On 16 February 2010, it was announced that Angel was going to be competing on the first season of "NXT" under the name Justin Gabriel, with Matt Hardy as his storyline mentor.
She understands while the bridegroom is other than his Ravi.
He made his in-ring debut on the 2 March 2010 episode of "NXT" in a tag team match with his mentor Hardy, against the team of William Regal and Skip Sheffield.
Terrified, she asks to the driver to accelerate so that he arrives in time, so that she can prevent this union between Ravi and Ruku.
Gabriel and Hardy won the match when Gabriel pinned Regal, making him the first rookie to pin a pro on the show.
Once there, it is with surprise that she notices that Ravi waited for her.
He went on to defeat Wade Barrett the following week, before suffering his first defeat on the 16 March 2010 episode of "NXT," when he and Hardy were defeated by CM Punk and Darren Young.
Indeed, Ruku decided otherwise and decided by mutual agreement, to get married, with the man who left quite behind him, for her, by love, Sekhar.
On 30 March, in the first Pros Poll, Gabriel was ranked third behind Daniel Bryan (first) and Wade Barrett (second).
Whereas now married, also, for ever, Ravi and Philomena savors every second of their common existence...
Before the first elimination, Gabriel won the Rookie Challenge earning immunity from elimination in the following Pros Poll.
"... Oru Bhagavad Gita-laiyo, oru Quran-laiyo, oru Bible-laiyo, ippadithan oru sambavam nadakanuna adhu maaththu yaaraalum mudiyathu!
In that Poll, Gabriel remained in third place behind Wade Barrett (who was moved to first) and David Otunga (second).

One of the officers present during the Combatant Status Review Tribunals convened at the Guantanamo Bay detention camps, in Cuba, was known as the Recorder.
At the Fatal 4-Way pay-per-view, the seven rookies interfered in the WWE Championship match and cost Cena the championship.
The structure of the Tribunals loosely resembled the Tribunals described in Army Regulation 190-8, with the key difference that AR-190-8 Tribunals used the definition of "combatant" consistent with that in the Geneva Conventions, while the a much broader definition of "enemy combatant" was used at Guantanamo.
The following week on "Raw," Vince McMahon fired Hart and announced the hiring of a new General Manager, who had signed the seven season one "NXT" rookies to contracts.
As in the AR-190-8 Tribunals a panel of three officers were authorized to make a determination whether or not an individual had been properly classified as a combatant.
The following week, the group was named The Nexus.
An additional officer was charged with the responsibility of assembling the evidence the three officers would use in making their determination, and with the responsibility to present that information to the three officers.
On the 12 July episode of "Raw", The Nexus competed in their first match together, without Darren Young, a six–on–one handicap match against John Cena, which they won when Gabriel pinned Cena.
For the CSR Tribunals that officer was known as the "Recorder", and was always a military lawyer.
The Nexus continued to feud with Cena and the Raw roster, resulting in a seven-on-seven elimination tag team match at SummerSlam.
The Recorders were Majors, Lieutenant Commanders, Lieutenant Colonels or Commanders.
Gabriel was one of the final two Nexus members in the match, but Cena's team won when Cena eliminated Gabriel and then Barrett to win the match.
The Presidents of the CSR Tribunals were always Colonels or Captains.
On 3 October 2010, Cena was forced to join The Nexus as a result of losing to Barrett at Hell in a Cell and at the following pay-per-view, Cena and Otunga won the WWE Tag Team Championship.
CSR Tribunals added a fifth officer, the Personal Representative, whose responsibility was to meet with the captive, try to explain the CSR Tribunal process to them, learn their account of themselves, and present their account to the Tribunal if the captive chose not to attend, or proved unable to present their account themselves.
On the 25 October 2010 episode of "Raw," Barrett made a tag team match, with Gabriel and Heath Slater facing Otunga and Cena for the championship.
In the AR-190-8 Tribunal only the President was required to be a field grade officer.
Gabriel and Slater won when Barrett ordered Otunga to allow Slater to pin him, becoming the new Tag Team Champions.
As they were conducted all the officers sitting on the CSR Tribunals were field grade officers.
Gabriel and Slater held the championship for nearly two months before losing it to Santino Marella and Vladimir Kozlov in a four-way elimination match, also involving The Usos and Mark Henry and Yoshi Tatsu on 6 December.

The book contains four poems which outline a fictional invention—an alarm clock that consists of a burning candle inserted in the sleeper's anus, containing markings for each hour to be spent sleeping.

The three remaining members of The Corre feuded with Jackson until the 10 June episode of "SmackDown", when Barrett walked out on Gabriel and Slater during a six-man tag team match against Jackson and the Usos, causing Gabriel and Slater to proclaim the end of The Corre.
The poem fits in a tradition of scatological and rectal poems, many of which were collected by Komrij in his "Komrij's Cacaphonia: An Encyclopedia of Shit" (2006).
Gabriel continued to ally himself with Slater despite the dissolution of The Corre, and the duo began a feud with The Usos.

All three plays were banned by the censor.
Gabriel did not perform on pay-per-view for 2013; from May, he largely wrestled singles matches on "Main Event" and "Superstars", with wins over Curt Hawkins and Darren Young, but lost to other wrestlers including Antonio Cesaro, Big E Langston, Damien Sandow, and Fandango.
It dramatises the story of Ivan IV of Russia and is written in blank verse.
He was involved in a storyline in September; after weeks of authority figure Triple H emasculating the WWE roster, Gabriel and several other babyfaces finally saved Daniel Bryan from a beatdown by the Shield and Randy Orton on the 16 September episode of "Raw".
Tolstoy was influenced by the work of William Shakespeare in writing the trilogy, which formed the core of his reputation as a writer in the Russia of his day and as a dramatist to this day.
In response, Triple H arranged for Gabriel and Zack Ryder to face Luke Harper and Erick Rowan of The Wyatt Family on the next "SmackDown", where Gabriel's team lost.
In the early 1863 Aleksey Tolstoy informed Yakov Polonsky in a letter from Dresden that he was working upon "a large poem in verse "The Death of Ioann Grozny"… Two acts of it are being finished and, as people tell me, are good", he added.
On the next episode of "Raw", Bryan, Gabriel and the other babyfaces faced the Shield in an 11-on-3 handicap elimination match; Gabriel was eliminated by Roman Reigns, but his team eventually won the match last eliminating Seth Rollins.
The deterioration of health hindered the creative process, but Act 3 has been completed by the summer of that year and in the end of 1863 the play was virtually ready.
In January 2014, the "Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter" released a ranking of WWE's roster; Gabriel was ranked as a lower-tier babyface.
Some details as to the original draft of it have been traced through Tolstoy's correspondence with Karolina Pavlova who was translating the text into German, and was being asked to make changes according to those Tolstoy was making to his original text.
He wrestled one match on pay-per-view for 2014, that being the André the Giant Memorial battle royal at WrestleMania XXX, which Gabriel failed to win.
Some of the scenes that have been excluded by the author from the final version of the play looked significant, one being Boris Godunov's conversation with tsarina Anastasia Romanovna about her granting him trusteeship right over Dmitry after Ioann and Fyodor's respective deaths.
In mid-2014, Gabriel began competing more on "NXT", which was now the show for WWE's rebranded developmental branch, but even there, Gabriel lost all of his televised singles matches, including to Adrian Neville, Tyler Breeze and Hideo Itami.
Also cut has been the scene of Godunov's talk with Dmitry's nanny.
After losing to Sami Zayn on the 3 July 2014 episode of "NXT", Gabriel turned heel for the second time since 2011 by joining his former partner Tyson Kidd in a post-match assault on Zayn.
Both, according to Tolstoy, precipitated "Tsar Fiodor Ioannovich", the second play of the trilogy and both have made their way into it later, although, as critics noticed, some fragments of which exactly the same could be said, have been kept in the original text.
The following week on "NXT", Gabriel and Kidd's reunion was initially successful as they defeated Neville and Zayn in a tag match, but Zayn got revenge when he and Adam Rose eliminated Gabriel and Kidd in a tournament to determine the number one contenders to the NXT Tag Team Championship on the 7 August episode of "NXT".
Making preparations for the first separate edition of the play, which came in November, 1866, Tolstoy again made changes.
Gabriel's last televised victory was on the 11 September 2014 episode of "Superstars" against Sin Cara.
In the magazine version in both scenes of Act 1 there's been no mention of any negotiations with the British ambassador.
His last title opportunity came on the 28 November 2014 episode of "SmackDown", when he was the first eliminated from a battle royal for the United States Championship.
The final Zakharyin's words ("Forgive us all!
His last televised match was a loss to Rusev on the 14 January 2015 episode of "Main Event".
Here's the price we have to pay for "edinovlastye", for our own corruption") also appeared for the first time in the book version, summing up what was obviously the drama’s main idea.
The "Wrestling Observer Newsletter" reported on 24 January 2015 that Gabriel had quit WWE, one day before the 2015 Royal Rumble in which he was scheduled to compete.
Tolstoy was taking into account other people’s opinions he was becoming aware of.
WWE officially confirmed his release on 25 January 2015.
In the Act 5 he dropped some archaisms and also several of the skomorokhs’ couplets, so as to avoid the unwanted comic effect.
In March 2015, he did an interview with Chris Jericho on the podcast "Talk is Jericho", where he revealed that he was the popular bunny character of Adam Rose's Exotic Express and that the Adam Rose character was intended for him.
The major source for Tolstoy as he was working upon the drama (as it was with the whole trilogy) was "History of the Russian State" by Nikolay Karamzin.
He also mentioned that Triple H did not approve of his ideas for a wolf-themed daredevil persona he had written his own promos for.
The whole of the Act 1 is based upon one small fragment in Vol.IX of it describing Ioann's feelings after the killing of his son, his relinquishing the throne, boyars' reaction to this and his consent to (as he put it) "bear this burden of rule for some more time" Details of this fragment of "History" have been expanded by Tolstoy into full-blown scenes: Zakharyev addressing boyars, Ioann's musing on the possibility of taking a schema oath, his conversation with boyars.
On 25 January 2015, it was announced that Lloyd would be making his first post-WWE appearance for Pro Wrestling Syndicate (PWS) on 31 January as "The Darewolf" PJ Black, resuming his previous ring name along with a new moniker.
The messengerэs tale in the Scene 2, Act 1 was based upon Karamzin's description of the Pskov siege which Tolstoy has taken numerous details from, moving them together, chronologically.
At the EVOLVE 38 iPPV event held on 8 March, Black defeated Caleb Konley following a springboard 450 splash.
The Garaburda scene (exceptionally important for the play's structure, according to the author's "Production plan") has been totally made up, but again, some details involved have been taken from Karamzin (Mikhail Garaburda's negotiations with Grozny in 1573, among others).
On 6 May 2015, Global Force Wrestling (GFW) announced PJ Black as part of their roster On 24 July 2015, Black entered the GFW NEX*GEN Championship Tournament to crown the inaugural champion, he defeated Seiya Sanada in the first round of the tournament.
Apart from Karamzin's "History" Tolstoy used, albeit to a lesser extent, "Tales of Prince Kurbsky", published in 1831 by N.Ustryalov.
On 23 October 2015 Black defeated Jigsaw, TJ Perkins and Virgil Flynn in a four way.
Kurbsky's letters in Scene 2, Act 1, present a mosaic of his real letters, the 1679 one featuring most prominently.
match to become the first ever GFW NEX*GEN Champion.
In the Act 4 the Ivan Grozny synodic text reading quotes a real document.
On 27 November 2015, Black lost the NEX*GEN Championship to Sonjay Dutt.
The play's major characters are historical figures, most of the minor ones (servants, stolniks) are fictional.
It was later announced that Black dropped the title because he was departing to Lucha Underground.
One notable exception is a Pskovian messenger, a figure featuring in historical chronicles.
On 26 March, Black unsuccessfully challenged Drew Galloway for the Evolve Championship.
The Boyar duma members have names of real people, one exception being Sitsky, a totally fictitious part.
On 2 July 2016, Black defeated Ivan Kiev at "GWF Summer Smash" to become the GWF Berlin Champion.
According to Tolstoy, the action of drama takes place in 1584, the year of Ioann's death.
On 5 February 2017, Black teamed with Nixon Newell defeated Guilty By Habit (Damian Dunne and Robbie X) to become the SWE Tag Team Championships.
Yet, Ivan's murdering his son, the abdication, the siege of Pskov, the fire in Aleksandrovskaya sloboda all relate to the second half of 1581.
On 12 March 2017, they lost the titles back to Guilty By Habit in a rematch.
Tolstoy was improvising a lot when it came to motives and undercurrents, occasionally creating links between things historians thought were unrelated.
After seven months on inactivity for his jumping injury, Black returned in a Wrestlecade show teaming with Willie Mack and Jason Kincaid but were defeated by Juventud Guerrerra, Super Crazy and Caleb Konley.
Having greatly increased the historical role of Boris Godunov, he's made him take part in several events had no bearing to.
On 2 March it was announced that former WWE Superstars and members of The Nexus faction Darren Young, Michael Tarver and Justin Gabriel will be competing at this year’s Chikara: King of Trios tournament.
According to I.Yampolsky, Boris' speech in Duma, the clash with Sitsky, addressing Tsar Ivan on behalf of Duma asking for his return to the throne, his opposition to the monarch's marrying Princess of Hastings and unwilling support for tsarina Maria, Ivan's advise for Fyodor to always listen to what Boris would say, - were all author's artistic inventions.
On 12 August, Black took part in a TNA angle where GFW invaded Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA).
The idea of expanding it into a trilogy came to Tolstoy while he was working on Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich, but, as I.Yampolsky notes, "The Death of Ioann the Terrible" gives the impression some future development of Godunov's character already having been on author’s mind.
During that day's "Impact Wrestling" tapings, Black defeated Lashley, Chris Masters, Eric Young and Robbie E in a King of the Mountain match to win the vacant TNA King of the Mountain Championship and on the 19 August episode of Impact, Black got a shot at the TNA World Heavyweight Championship against Ethan Carter III but lost the match.
The appearance of Mikhail Bityagovsky in the play, the figure which according to historical sources would come upon the scene many years later, could be seen as pointing to this, too.
On the 2 September episode of Impact, Black lost the King of the Mountain Championship to Bobby Roode.
Besides, Tolstoy created new logical threads between Bityagovsky's taking part in the conflict between Boris and boyars, his agitation of people against Shuisky and Belsky - to the murder of Dmitry.
After Team TNA members Drew Galloway, Lashley, Bram and The Wolves (Davey Richards and Eddie Edwards) defeated Team GFW members Jeff Jarrett, Chris Masters, Brian Myers, Sonjay Dutt and Eric Young in a Lethal Lockdown match for Jeff Jarrett's share of the company, the invasion angle ended.
"The Death of Ivan the Terrible" was first performed at the Alexandrinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg in 1867.
On 14 November 2015, at the first set of Lucha Underground tapings for their second season, Black made his lucha debut for the organization and lost his first match against The Mack.
It was not a success, due to the lead role having been given to a comic actor.
On 24 February 2016, Black lost his second match to Jack Evans.
The world-famous Moscow Art Theatre began its second season with a production of the play, which opened on 29 September 1899.
On the 25 May episode of "Lucha Underground", Black and Evans were scheduled to compete for the Lucha Underground Trios Championship alongside Fénix, but Fénix was attacked by Johnny Mundo.
It was directed by the seminal theatre practitioner Constantin Stanislavski, who also played the lead role initially.
As Mundo revealed himself as Fénix's replacement, Black and Evans allied with Mundo and his valet Taya.
When Stanislavski fell ill after the first few performances, he was replaced by Vsevolod Meyerhold.
Black, Evans, and Mundo, now known as Worldwide Underground, defeated Rey Mysterio Jr., Prince Puma and Dragon Azteca Jr. to win the Lucha Underground Trios Championship, the first championship for each in "Lucha Underground".
The play received its first New York production in 1904, which opened on 1 March at the New Amsterdam Theatre on Broadway in a translation by S. R. DeMeissner.
They lost their titles to Aero Star, Drago and Fénix at the third and final part Ultima Lucha Dos, which aired on 20 July.
George Eric Gordon (1905–1992) was an Anglican bishop in the 20th century.
On the 7 December episode of "Lucha Underground", Black lost to Sexy Star in which if Sexy Star won, she would face Worldwide Underground leader Johnny Mundo for the Lucha Underground Championship.
He was born on 29 July 1905 and educated at St Olave's Grammar School and the St Catharine's College, Cambridge.
Black participated in the Battle of the Bulls tournament for a number one contender spot for the Lucha Underground Championship.
Ordained in 1929 he began his career with a curacy at Holy Trinity, Leicester, after which he was Vice-Principal of Bishop Wilson College, Isle of Man.
He lasted until the finals where he failed to win a fatal-four way elimination match also involving Cage, Jeremiah Crane and The Mack, the latter of which last eliminating Black to win the match.
In 1935 he became Chaplain to William Stanton Jones, Bishop of Sodor and Man.
Sporting a new biker-look that included a hollywoodian beard, black vest and shoulder-length hair, Black wrestled NWA World Champion Nick Aldis to a five minute time limit draw at the 29 April 2018 Championship Wrestling from Hollywood TV taping, thereby earning a future opportunity at Aldis' title.
In 1942 he became Rector of Kersal then Rural Dean of Middleton.
Aldis had issued an open challenge offering to give any competitor lasting five minutes in the ring with him a future title opportunity.
From 1951 to 1966 he was Provost of Chelmsford Cathedral and Rector of Chelmsford when he was ordained to the episcopate as the Bishop of Sodor and Man, a post he held for eight years.
Lloyd has competed in numerous modeling contests.
In 1974 he retired to Eynsham in Oxfordshire.
He placed first in the Male Fitness Model Search held by FAME SA, sixth in the 2008 Mr Body Classic contest held by Mr & Ms Body Beautiful SA, eighth in the 2007 Men's Model Search held by Mr & Ms Fitness SA, and reached the top five in the Mr Physique Division in the 2008 Men's Model Search.
He died on 6 June 1992.
Lloyd appeared on Discovery Channel's "Shark After Dark" television program in August 2013.
Thujaplicins (isopropyl cycloheptatrienolones) are series of related chemical substances discovered in the 1930s and isolated from "Thuja plicata" (western redcedar tree).
In September 2013, he was featured on an episode of "Total Divas" as a love interest for JoJo.
The three compounds are α-thujaplicin, β-thujaplicin (hinokitiol), and γ-thujaplicin.
Gabriel made his video game debut in "WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2011" and had later appeared in "WWE '12", "WWE '13" and "WWE 2K14".
They are known for potent anti-fungal and anti-bacterial properties.
He also appears in "WWE 2K15" as Justin Gabriel and The Bunny (NPC, only appears in Adam Rose's entrance.)
They are also known to be potent antioxidants.
Lloyd has a degree in sports science he got in the United Kingdom.
They were the first natural tropolones to be made synthetically, by Ralph Raphael and colleagues.
Although he was born in Cape Town he resides in Pierre.
"Blackfella/Whitefella" is an Australian country rock song written by Neil Murray and George Rrurrambu, recorded by their Aboriginal rock group, Warumpi Band, and released as the sole single from their 1985 album, "Big Name, No Blankets" on Parole Records and Powderworks Records.
He obtained US Citizenship in April 2016 but maintains his South African citizenship.
While not a chart success, the song drew attention to issues of racism in Australia through lyrics that encourage harmony and co-operation by people of all races.
Lloyd has suffered through two base jumping accidents.
The song received national airplay and attention in 1986 when politically charged rockers and Powderworks Records founders Midnight Oil accompanied the band on a free concert tour of remote Aboriginal communities as the Blackfella/Whitefella Tour.
The most recent of which occurred in the summer of 2017 and resulted in Lloyd losing a finger.
Songwriter Neil Murray's inspiration for "Blackfella/Whitefella" came from his experience as a white man working in Papunya, a predominately Indigenous community north west of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory from 1980.
Shattered Trust: The Shari Karney Story is a 1993 American made-for-television drama film directed by Bill Corcoran.
Although he was part of a minority, Murray found that in the isolated community, everybody was getting along, enjoying activities such as music and football.
The film, which is based upon the true story of Shari Karney, garnered generally positive reviews.
In 1985, after discussing the song and its message with band mates Sammy Butcher and George Rrurrambu, the later suggested that Murray include "yellafella" (a term sometimes used to refer to individuals of mixed race) in the lyrics, broadening the message of the song to include people from all places.
However, it was criticized for exploiting a real incest case for entertainment use.
In 1985 "Blackfella/Whitefella" appeared as the second track on Warumpi Band's debut album, "Big Name, No Blankets" on Parole Records and Powderworks Records.
Situated in the early 1980s, Shari Karney is a successful attorney, assigned to an incest case, involving a three-year-old girl, Christie, who is being molested by her father.
The single was included as an addition track on Australian and International 12" single releases of Midnight Oil's "The Dead Heart" released in July 1986.
She initially refuses to take the case, explaining that she isn't familiar with cases involving sexual abuse.
A 30-minute documentary film entitled "Blackfella/Whitefella" produced by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation was released in 1987.
She is later convinced by the child's mother, Darlene Holland, but the trial proves to be difficult.
The film inspired by the song showcases both Warumpi Band and Midnight Oil while touring together through Central Australia in 1986 and deals with both music and politics.
Nine months later, she is heavily invested in the case, which involves her private life.
In 2012, a children's book of the same name containing the song's lyrics accompanied by illustrations by Australian children was published by One Day Hill.
She has trouble sleeping at night and is often bothered by flashbacks of her own past.
"Blackfella Whitefella" is part of a series containing the lyrics of iconic songs which are intended to educate children on the history of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and their struggle for recognition and equal rights.
Whenever she tries to make love with her boyfriend Mark, she suffers panic attacks.
The book was launched by musician Archie Roach, with a percentage of book sales intended to support the Papunya community.
She eventually attacks David Holland, the man charged, in the courtroom and is therefore sent to jail for two days.
The Dull Knife Battlefield is located on the eastern slope of the Bighorn Mountains in Johnson County, Wyoming near Kaycee.
Shari fears she has ruined the case, but Darlene insists on holding her as her lawyer.
It was the scene of the Dull Knife Fight on November 25, 1876, in which the Fourth Cavalry under General Ranald S. Mackenzie raided the winter encampment of the NorthernCheyenne, destroying most of their material culture and all their winter supplies and thus forcing the Northern Cheyenne to seek shelter with the village of Crazy Horse in order to survive the winter.
The judge, however, puts her on probation and forces her to seek psychological help.
Five hundred ponies were captured and about 173 lodges destroyed.
She contacts psychiatrist Joan Delvecchio and admits to her that she is constantly hearing typing sounds.
The Dull Knife battlefield is on private land and is available to visit only by special arrangement.
She reveals that as a child she was physically abused by her mother, and that her father had done nothing to protect her.
The fight took place on November 25, 1876.
Her sister Linda thinks therapy would be good for her, explaining that there must be a reason that she never wore make-up and always wore baggy clothes.
The battlefield site was considered by the Cheyenne to be sufficiently remote to be safe as winter quarters.
At court, David is prohibited from seeing his daughter for six months.
The location is now the site of a ranch.
Shari is furious that thereafter, he is allowed to see her again, claiming that he then will keep on raping her.
The site was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.
Meanwhile, in therapy, Joan notices that Shari shows the same symptoms as rape victims, but thinks it could be explained by her fathers's abuse.
The project was announced by Emaar Properties on 23 April 2008, with opening proposed for the end of 2009.
When Mark finds out she has taken another incest case, he leaves her.
The total cost was put at AED 500 million.
She turns to her parents, but her mother blames her for having driven Mark away.
The line is being built in three phases which will eventually form a 7 km loop around Downtown Dubai.
Her therapist makes her write a letter to her mother.
Phase 1 opened in 2015.
When writing, not only does she express the hatred she feels for her mother, but also reveals that she is an incest victim herself, having been abused by her father for years.
It runs in the median of the orbital Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Boulevard, with three stops serving The Address and the Manzil Downtown and Vida Downtown hotels.
She starts to remember everything and finds out that she buried the abuse so deep that she didn't consciously remember it.
Phase 1 was originally planned to be a double track express link shuttle service line operating between the Burj place interchange station with Dubai Metro and The Dubai Mall operational by end of 2009, but was put on hold in July 2010.
In sessions, Joan helps her remember the entire truth and eventually Shari tells that her father raped her after typing, which explains the sounds of typing she heard.
Phase 2 will include the full loop, providing a single track, mono-directional clockwise commuter service operating to and from the Burj Place interchange station with Dubai Metro.
She confronts her parents, but they respond with outrage, claiming they will never forgive her for the accusation.
It is expected to serve all ten stations in the network's development.
Linda refuses to believe her as well and has trouble even accepting the possibility.
The complete one-way journey time will take approximately 8 minutes.
At work, her new client withdraws and Christie is hospitalized.
Opening was originally planned for 2010.
Frustrated, she is determined to change the law, allowing incest victims to sue their parents whenever they want to, without a statute of limitations.
The heritage-style open-top double-decker trams built in the USA by TIG/m are powered by fuel cells, with batteries used to recover regenerated braking energy.
She contacts Stephanie Chadford, another lawyer who tried to change the incest law.
Robert L. Shafer (born May 10, 1932) is an American lawyer, lobbyist, and diplomat.
This requires her to step to the media, telling her own story.
Since 2004, Mr. Shafer has been the Permanent Observer for the Sovereign Military Order of Malta at the United Nations in New York City.
She is immediately estranged from her sister and disowned by her parents.
Mr. Shafer was born in Amery, Wisconsin and received a B.A. degree from St. John's University in Collegeville, Minnesota and a J.D. degree from Georgetown University.
Meanwhile, the process of changing a law proves to be exhausting, taking up to six years to even qualify in court, and her emotional involvement upsets her partners, who eventually fire her.
Mr. Shafer was employed at Pfizer for over 30 years and was Vice-president of Public Affairs and Government Relations of the corporation when he retired in 1996.
In the end, however, the law changes, with Shari's help.
As a representative of Pfizer, he lobbied the U.S. Congress and the governments of other countries where Pfizer had subsidiary corporations.
Parts of the film were shot in Salt Lake City, Utah.
On June 8, 2004, Mr. Shafer succeeded Jose Antonio Linati Bosch as the Sovereign Military Order of Malta's Permanent Observer at the UN.
It was a splinter group of nine Cumann na nGaedheal TDs led by Joseph McGrath, who had been Minister for Industry and Commerce in the Cumann na nGaedheal government.
Mr. Shafer has also been the Chairman of the Convent of the Sacred Heart in Greenwich, Connecticut; the director or member of the board of a number of mutual fund corporations; and a member of the Board of Regents of St. John's University.
McGrath founded the National Party in the aftermath of the Army Mutiny, the last military challenge to civilian authority in Ireland.
Dunwoody Village is a non-profit Continuing Care Retirement Community located in Newtown Square, a western suburb of Philadelphia.
The nine TDs protested the refusal of the government to reinstate mutineers among the officer corps in October 1924.
The community is built on the grounds of an campus that has a rich history of family ownership which reaches back to the time of the American Revolution.
The nine resigned their seats to run in simultaneous by-elections in March 1925, described as a "mini-general election", as a test of public opinion and sympathy with the mutiny.
The community is named for William Hood Dunwoody.
Seven of the polls were won by Cumann na nGaedheal; the other two were won by the abstentionist candidates of Sinn Féin, then led by Éamon de Valera.
It sits on land which his father James Dunwoody bought from his father-in-law, William Hood.
Sunkist is a brand of primarily orange flavored soft drinks launched in 1979.
Both the Hood and Dunwoody families had emigrated from England in the latter part of the 17th century.
Sunkist was first licensed by Sunkist Growers to the General Cinema Corporation, the leading independent bottler of Pepsi-Cola products at the time.
As a farm boy in the 1840s, William Dunwoody attended school at the Hood Octagonal School which still stands on the property.
The soft drink was the idea of Mark Stevens, who foresaw the potential based on market research which indicated that, worldwide, orange was the third best selling soft drink flavor (largely due to The Coca-Cola Company's Fanta brand).
After his schooling, Dunwoody learned to be a broker and dealer in grain from his uncle and by age 23 he formed the flour firm of Dunwoody & Robertson.
After extensive R&D during 1977 and early 1978, in which research was conducted on taste, color and carbonation levels, Sunkist made a grand introduction in New York by franchising it to The Coca-Cola Bottling Company of New York City, where Edward F. O'Reilly was president.
In his childhood, Dunwoody had been sickly and, at the age of 28, he took his physician’s advice by moving to Minnesota where he could remain active in the grain business.
It went national soon thereafter by being franchised mainly to leading Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola bottlers.
He joined Washburn-Crosby Co. in Minneapolis, a prominent milling firm that produced the highly successful Gold Medal Flour.
The advertising slogan was "fun, sun and the beach" using TV and radio commercials with the Beach Boys' hit song "Good Vibrations" as the brand's theme.
With them, Dunwoody pioneered overseas spring wheat sales and became a silent partner.
In 1980, Sunkist Orange Soda became the #1 orange soda in the USA and the 10th best selling soft drink.
After Dunwoody’s death, the company changed its commercial name to General Mills.
Unlike many other competing orange sodas, Sunkist contains caffeine (41.0mg).
Dunwoody spent the rest of his life in Minnesota, returning to Pennsylvania annually in order to visit his parents and siblings.
In 2010, there was a consumer recall after a batch was accidentally mixed with 6 times amount of the caffeine, sickening consumers.
Although the family farm had been subdivided after his parents’ death, William used a part of his immense wealth to reconsolidate it for the purpose of establishing a charitable home in memory of his parents.
In late 1984, Sunkist Soft Drinks was sold to Del Monte.
Dunwoody died in 1914, leaving a $1 million bequest to build a home in which sick or injured workers could recuperate until able to return to the workforce.
From late 1986 until 2008, it was produced by Cadbury Schweppes under license through its Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages subsidiary.
In 1924, the Dunwoody Home opened its doors to needy men and operated with a trust fund that continues to this day caring for those in need.
Following the demerger of Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages from Cadbury Schweppes, it is now produced by Keurig Dr Pepper in the USA.
By the late 1960s, recuperative care had been transformed by visiting nurses, hospital sponsored outpatient care, and homes with extensive infirmaries.
Sunkist (as a carbonated soft drink) is sold in the UK by Vimto Soft Drinks under license from Sunkist Growers.
As there was no longer a pressing societal need for the services of the Dunwoody Home, utilization declined and the facilities became outdated.
It is also sold in Australia by Schweppes Australia (a subsidiary of Asahi Breweries), but the Australian formulation is caffeine free.
On the other hand, the concept of a non-profit retirement community was evolving as a viable enterprise.
In Canada, a caffeine free version of the orange drink is marketed as C'Plus.
The trustees of the Home sought and obtained court permission to establish a retirement village with continuing care.
The package indicates that there is a small amount of Sunkist Juice.
The trustees would oversee both the Home and the Village but the two would be separate financially and operationally.
In the Philippines, it was sold by Cosmos Bottling until 2001, when San Miguel Corporation acquired Cosmos and sold its brands to Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc.
Thus Dunwoody Village came into being with its first residents arriving in late 1974.
As of 2013, Sunkist is sold by Asia Brewery.
This was early in the age of retirement villages as we know them today.
Keurig Dr Pepper makes a variety of Sunkist flavors.
As a result, the design of Dunwoody Village embraced some unique construction features seldom seen in subsequent retirement community designs.
The Ethiopia Commodity Exchange (ECX) is a commodities exchange established April 2008 in Ethiopia.
These include heated hallways connecting all parts of the complex, atria with natural light and growing plants spread throughout the complex, and cinder block walls to isolate noise and prevent the spread of fire.
In Proclamation 2007-550, which created the ECX, its stated objective was "to ensure the development of an efficient modern trading system" that would "protect the rights and benefits of sellers, buyers, intermediaries, and the general public."
An operating feature quite uncommon within continuing care communities elsewhere was United States postal delivery to each apartment door.
The ECX is set up as a private company owned by a partnership of the market actors, members of the exchange, and the Ethiopian government, led by Eleni Gebre Medhin a former economist for the International Food Policy Research Institute and the World Bank.
The accommodation plan for independent living was ahead of its time.
As of July 2011, the physical presence of the ECX consists of 55 warehouses in 17 regional locations.
Not only was there a mixture of studio, one bedroom, and two bedroom apartments, there were apartment suites located at ground level.
It has grown from trading 138,000 tons in its first year to 508,000 tons in its third year, with nearly equal shares of coffee and oilseeds and pulses.
These were termed country houses.
The value of the ECX rose 368% between 2010 and 2011 to reach US$1.1 billion.
Many communities developed at a later time offered villas, but these were free standing structures that involved some degree of exposure to the weather for residents to reach the core facility.
As of November 2010, the trading floor in Addis Ababa handled 200 spot contracts in commodities such as coffee, sesame, navy beans, maize and wheat.
Dunwoody Village opened with skilled nursing and personal care facilities.
It was assessed in July 2011 that membership equaled 243 with clients, who trade through members, about 7,800.
Over the years, some of the notable improvements have been establishment of a long-term nursing pavilion, upgrading all double occupancy nursing rooms to single occupancy, and the means to provide special care for dementia patients.
Farmer cooperatives represented 2.4 millions smallholder farmers, which make up 12% of the membership.
The headwaters of Hunter Run rise on the grounds of Dunwoody Village.
Currently, the ECX is the only stock or commodity exchange in Africa to have streamlined payment transfers down to "T+1" (ext day payment after a trade) from its clearinghouse to its partner commercial banks.
A large barn for farm animals built in 1924 to support the Dunwoody Home still stands.
"Push" price date is transmitted in real time to outdoor electronic ticker boards in 32 rural sites, the ECX website, 256,000 mobile subscribers via instant messaging, the radio, TV and print media.
Unusual in having a glazed brick silo for fodder storage, this landmark gives a visual link to the historic nature of the property.
"Pull" market data is available through a toll-free phone-in service.
The Hood Octagonal School building occupies a prominent position on the grounds.
The service received more than 1 million calls in September 2011, 70% coming from rural callers.
Once thought to date back to 1798, thorough research revealed that it was erected in 1842 and the schoolhouse was entered on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.
The first year of the Ethiopia Commodity Exchange's existence is documented in the PBS Wide Angle film "The Market Maker".
An iconic image of the schoolhouse is used as the logo of Dunwoody Village and by the municipality.
David D'Antoni (born 28 January 1979) is an Italian footballer who played over 150 games at Italian Serie B.
The Dunwoody Home itself outlived its ability to provide charitable care both financially and structurally.
Born in Viterbo, Lazio, D'Antoni played for Ladispoli at Serie D in Lazio region.
It was closed in 1991 and demolished in May 1992.
He then signed by Empoli and made debut in Serie A on 25 October 1998 against U.C. Sampdoria.
The few remaining residents were accommodated charitably in Dunwoody Village.
He then played at Serie C2 clubs and won promotion with Vis Pesaro.
Calvert Charlton Miller, (September 3, 1899 - July 1, 1978), was a Canadian lawyer, politician and jurist.
He then played for Salernitana, Cesena, Genoa and Venezia.
Miller was born and raised in Portage la Prairie.
In January 2005, he joined current club Frosinone.
He articled in the law firm of Meighen and Sexsmith, the law firm founded by future Prime Minister Arthur Meighen.
The house was built in 1890 by early Redlands residents David and Sarah Morey for $20,000, profits from the sale of their citrus nursery.
Miller was called to the bar in 1920 and practiced law in Portage la Prairie and was respected in his field, being elected a bencher of the Law Society of Manitoba.
Following the Moreys' deaths in 1901, the house's second owners were Willard R. and Nancy Cheney, the brother and sister-in-law of Helen Cheney Kimberly, who was the wife of one of the founders of Kimberly-Clark Corporation.
He was active with the Conservative Party of Manitoba serving as president of the provincial association.
In the 1940s, it was reportedly owned by actress Carole Lombard's uncle and left to her in his will, but she died before she could take ownership.
In 1946, he was elected in a by-election to the House of Commons of Canada as the Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament for Portage la Prairie following the death of Harry Leader.
Shortly after, the mansion was purchased by Willard M. and Florence Wiseman, and then sold in 1969 to Curtiss and Phyllis Allen.
His riding was abolished due to redistribution and Miller did not run in another electoral district in the 1949 federal election and instead retired from politics and returned to his law practice until 1959 when he was named to the Court of Queen's Bench of Manitoba.
The Allens owned it during the 1970s.
In 1960, he was appointed to Manitoba's Court of Appeal and in 1961 he was named Chief Justice of Manitoba.
Mr. Allen had seen the house as a young boy while in Redlands; he told someone that he was going to own that house one day.
He retired from the bench in 1967.
A friend told him it was for sale and Mr. Allen purchased it immediately.
Phillip Paul Lloyd (born 3 March 1981) is a South African professional wrestler.
The house was featured in the film "Talk About a Stranger" (1952) as the house of the character Dr. Paul Mahler, alias Matlock.
He is best known for his time in WWE, under the ring name Justin Gabriel.
The mansion opened as the first bed and breakfast in Redlands in 1985 under then-owners Carl Ljungquist and Gary Conway.
He is currently signed to Lucha Underground under the ring name PJ Black.
The house was purchased by Janet Cosgrove in 1998, who oversaw renovation work to the building before reopening it as a bed and breakfast in 2006.
A second-generation wrestler, Lloyd was initially trained by his father.
In 2010, Sara and Bill Taylor bought the mansion for sole use as their private residence.
Debuting in 1997 at the age of 16, where he competed in the United Kingdom and South Africa, and was the inaugural winner of the WWP World Cruiserweight Championship in World Wrestling Professionals as PJ Black.
In 2012 the house went into foreclosure.
In 2008, Lloyd signed a developmental contract with World Wrestling Entertainment, and was assigned to Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), WWE's developmental territory, where he won the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship, with Kris Logan, and the FCW Florida Heavyweight Championship.
In January 2014, ownership was returned to Janet Cosgrove.
In February 2010, he competed in the first season of "NXT", finishing third, before being called to the main roster in June 2010 joining The Nexus.
Meindert Leerling (born 11 January 1936 in Heerjansdam) is a Dutch former politician, television director and (sports) journalist.
He joined The Corre in 2011.
Previously he worked as a television director and RTV journalist for the Evangelical Broadcasting (Evangelische Omroep) and as a sports journalist for several newspapers.
Teaming regularly with Heath Slater, the duo won the WWE Tag Team Championship three times in 2010 and 2011, which was the apex of Gabriel's success with WWE.
Meindert Leerling has been married twice (his first wife died in 1999) and is a member of the Protestant Church in the Netherlands (PKN).
He also won the TNA King of the Mountain Championship during his brief GFW crossover appearances with TNA in 2015.
Liberty Downtown Historic District is a historic district located at Liberty in Sullivan County, New York.
Lloyd was originally trained by his father, a promoter and wrestler in South Africa, who was also known by his ring name The Pink Panther.
The district includes 112 contributing buildings and comprises the village's commercial core.
His grandfather was a professional boxer and amateur wrestler.
It subsumes the Liberty Village Historic District listed in 1978, which had 12 contributing buildings.
Lloyd grew up watching his father wrestle and in the early part of his training he used to practice in the backyard of his home, in which two rings were positioned.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 and 2006.
He made his professional wrestling debut at the age of 16.
Allan Bérubé (1946–2007) helped to establish the enlarged historic district.
Using the ring name "PJ Black", he formed a regular tag team with Ray Leppan called Pure Juice.
Continuous revelation or continuing revelation is a theological belief or position that God continues to reveal divine principles or commandments to humanity.
His father was shot and killed in front of him during Lloyd's final year in high school, and a year later he moved to the United Kingdom for five years.
In Christian traditions, it is most commonly associated with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), and with Pentecostal and Charismatic Christianity, though it is found in some other denominations as well.
Lloyd spent five years in the United Kingdom, where he trained with Frontier Wrestling Alliance.
Continuous revelation also forms part of the rituals of gatherings in various chapters of Taoism.
He was trained by Alex Shane and Mark Sloan.
A notable factor of continuous or continuing revelation as a source of divine commandments and statements is the written recording of such statements in a more open scriptural canon, as is the case with the Latter-Day Saints; while more frequent with the Latter-Day Saints, it is less frequent with the Baha'i Faith, with progressive revelation only being periodically expanded over an extremely long period.
In 2003 he made his FWA debut.
Conservative Judaism teaches God's revelation at Mount Sinai and God's continuing revelation through study of Jewish texts and through life as a Jewish believer.
He also made an appearance in International Pro Wrestling: United Kingdom.
Vatican II states “no new public revelation is to be expected before the glorious manifestation of our Lord, Jesus Christ.”
He debuted for the South African promotion World Wrestling Professionals (WWP) in 2005.
The notion of progressive or continuing revelation is not held by the Roman Catholic Church or by Eastern Orthodoxy, who instead favor the idea of tradition and development of doctrine, while progressivist and continuationist approaches are specifically condemned in the declaration Dominus Iesus.
In 2006, he returned to South Africa full-time, and returned to WWP.
Protestants generally teach that the modern age is not a period of continuing revelation.
His most notable feuds during his tenure in WWP were against Tornado, Dameon Duke, Mikey Whiplash, and Joe E. Legend.
The Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) affirm continuing revelation through the Inner light or the light within, which is the presence of God which provides illumination and guidance to the individual and through individuals to the group.
On 1 November 2007, Black became the promotion's inaugural World Cruiserweight Champion, by defeating The Playa in a match to determine the inaugural champion.
Some Friends consider the Bible the ultimate authority, but others consider the Inner Light to be above the Bible.
After holding the championship for 13 days, he lost it to Lizzard on 14 November.
Both groups believe that the Inner Light speaks to people directly and not just through the text of the Bible.
He then declared his intentions to compete in WWP's heavyweight division.
Because Friends believe that revelation is ongoing, they have no set creed or dogmas.
Lloyd challenged unsuccessfully for the WWP World Heavyweight Championship against Joe E Legend on a "WWP Thunderstrike" episode that aired on 10 January 2009.
However, as early Friends listened to the Inner light and endeavored to live accordingly, a common set of beliefs gradually emerged, which became known as testimonies.
During the match he suffered minor burns to the face after a fireball spot did not go as originally planned, and he had to be treated in hospital.
Although rooted in the immediate experience of the community of Friends, these Testimonies are based on what Friends believe are verified in the Bible, especially as described in the Gospels regarding the life and teachings of Jesus.
His final match in South Africa took place on 8 November 2008 at WWP's bi-annual Carnival City Casino show, where he was defeated by Terri Middoux in front of a record attendance.
Pentecostal and Charismatic Christians generally believe that Christians, especially "Spirit-filled" Christians can receive revelations from God in the form of dreams, visions, and audible or inaudible voices.
In 2008, Lloyd signed a three-year developmental deal with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), becoming the first South African person to do so.
They also believe that certain individuals are able to transmit revelations from God in the form of prophecy, words of knowledge, and speaking in tongues and interpretation of tongues.
He was assigned to Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), WWE's developmental territory, where he made his debut under his real name on 5 February, in a loss to Kawal.
While most Pentecostals and Charismatics believe the Bible to be the ultimate authority and would not say that any new revelation can ever contradict the Bible, they do believe that God continues to speak to people today on extra-biblical topics as well as to interpret and apply the text of the Bible.
His first win in FCW came the following week, when he teamed with Caylen Croft and Trent Barreta to defeat Tyler Reks, Johnny Curtis, and DJ Gabriel in a six-man tag team match.
Mormonism makes a distinction between personal revelation and revelation directed to all members of the church.
The following month, he changed his ring name to 'Justin Angel'.
They believe that personal revelation can come to any individual with a righteous desire, for example to direct someone in their search for truth.
He went on to wrestle against DH Smith, Barreta, Yoshitatsu, and Lance Hoyt over the next few months.
In contrast, revelation for the entire church only comes to those who have been called by God as prophets, which in the LDS Church includes the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.
In June, he formed a tag team with Kris Logan, with the pair defeating DJ Gabriel and Vic Adams in their debut match as a team.
Mormons regard revelation through prophets as an indispensable element of Christ's church, without which the church would be led by man, not God.
They quickly began to feud with The Dude Busters of Barreta and Croft, losing to them in several championship matches over the next month.
Continued revelation is essential for matters affecting the church as a whole, including guiding the church through changing world conditions, keeping doctrine pure and unadulterated, revealing new doctrine and scripture in the times appointed by God, and making policy or organizational changes as the church grows and evolves.
At the 23 July 2009 tapings of FCW's television show, Angel and Logan defeated Barreta and Croft to become the Florida Tag Team Champions.
In contrast to the Mainstream Christian belief that God has "sealed up the heavens" in terms of church-wide revelation, Mormons believe God continues to follow the pattern that he adhered to throughout the entire span of the Bible, which was to reveal his will and doctrine through prophets.
They lost the championship on the same night to The Rotundos (Bo and Duke).
Mormons see the tendency to dismiss the possibility that God could call modern prophets as similar to the attitude of those in the Bible who rejected the prophets and/or apostles of their day.
Following the loss of the championship, Angel and Logan dissolved as a tag team, with Angel returning to singles competition.
As demonstrated by the Jews in the time of Jesus, it is often much less challenging to accept prophets of prior ages, rather than a contemporary prophet.
He went on a winning streak throughout August, defeating Alex Riley, Vance Archer, and Sheamus.
Granted, the work of a prophet has always been to dispel false beliefs and warn against behaviors that are contrary to God's will, which inevitably creates friction when viewed as a threat to firmly entrenched traditions and mindsets.
Angel won the Florida Heavyweight Championship from Heath Slater in a two out of three falls match at the 24 September 2009 television tapings.
The sense of change in the message of Christ and the apostles led many to regard them as false prophets.
He successfully defended the championship against Drew McIntyre, Eric Escobar, Slater, and Curt Hawkins throughout late 2009.
Christ himself warned against false prophets, teaching that the way to distinguish between a true and a false prophet was "by their fruits" (Matt 7:15-20); however, the perceived threat to tradition was often a strong enough deterrent to cause the witnesses of good fruits (such as powerful sermons or miraculous healings) to dismiss them as the work of the devil (Matt 12:24).
In February 2010, he changed his ring name to 'Justin Gabriel' to coincide with his appearances on "NXT".
After Christ ordained his apostles, he warned them of the extreme opposition they would encounter for these reasons, telling them, "ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake" (Matt 10:16-23).
Further successful championship defenses occurred in early 2010, against competitors including Hawkins, Barreta, and Kaval.
Christ also said, “Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you!
After a near six-month reign, Gabriel lost the championship at the 18 March television tapings, when Alex Riley won a three-way match, which also included Wade Barrett.
For so did their fathers to the false prophets," thus illustrating that opposition will naturally accompany a true prophet if they are doing their job correctly (Luke 6:22-26).
Gabriel lost a rematch to Riley on 31 March and again on 20 May.
Sometimes the opposition against God's prophets escalated to the point of violence and martyrdom, which Jesus and the apostles frequently referenced while preaching to their detractors (Matt 23:31-37, Luke 11:47-51, Acts 7:52, Romans 11:3, 1 Thes 2:15).
In May, he started a feud with fellow South African Leo Kruger over who was the better wrestler.
In this sense, Mormons acknowledge that revelation has not continued uninterrupted throughout history, being that the killing of God's prophets sometimes resulted in periods without church-wide revelation—which Mormons refer to as apostasies.
On 10 June, Gabriel beat Kruger, but Kruger reversed the result in a rematch at the 1 July television tapings, which was Gabriel's final appearance in FCW.
Similar to prophets before them, Peter and the apostles also suffered martyrdom at the hands of their persecutors—with the exception of John who was banished to the Isle of Patmos.
On 16 February 2010, it was announced that Angel was going to be competing on the first season of "NXT" under the name Justin Gabriel, with Matt Hardy as his storyline mentor.
In contrast to the Mainstream Christian view that the apostolic era came to a close because revelation had reached its completion, Mormons see it not as God's will but as a tragic result of the overwhelming persecution that plagued the church in that era, which cut short the program of apostolic succession that had commenced when Judas was replaced by Matthias (Acts 1:23-26).
He made his in-ring debut on the 2 March 2010 episode of "NXT" in a tag team match with his mentor Hardy, against the team of William Regal and Skip Sheffield.
The apostasy that followed is referred to as the Great Apostasy, because it lasted longer than prior periods without prophets.
Gabriel and Hardy won the match when Gabriel pinned Regal, making him the first rookie to pin a pro on the show.
Mormons believe that once the Christian church was no longer led by revelation, its doctrine began to be altered by theologians who took it upon themselves to continue developing doctrine, despite not being called or authorized to receive revelation for the church body.
He went on to defeat Wade Barrett the following week, before suffering his first defeat on the 16 March 2010 episode of "NXT," when he and Hardy were defeated by CM Punk and Darren Young.
In the absence of revelation, these theologians often resorted to speculation, which coupled with their own interpretations and extrapolations of scripture, inevitably resulted in disagreement and division on many doctrinal points.
On 30 March, in the first Pros Poll, Gabriel was ranked third behind Daniel Bryan (first) and Wade Barrett (second).
Ecumenical councils were held in order to settle these differences, yet without prophets called and authorized to reveal God's will on the topics being debated, the attendees could only vote on the theories presented in order to decide which ones would become official doctrine—a practice that served to ostracize as heretics those who didn't go along with these decisions, and in some cases led to major schisms in the church.
Before the first elimination, Gabriel won the Rookie Challenge earning immunity from elimination in the following Pros Poll.
Mormons view this process of doctrinal development as completely foreign to God's established pattern of revealing doctrine through a prophet.
In that Poll, Gabriel remained in third place behind Wade Barrett (who was moved to first) and David Otunga (second).
They point to history as incontrovertible proof that humans are incapable of agreeing on how to interpret the Bible (2 Pet 1:20), which should act as a strong indicator that God's purpose for the Bible was not to derive doctrine, but rather to support it.
In the season finale on 1 June, Gabriel was the first eliminated, finishing in third place overall in the competition.
When doctrine is not established and maintained through continued revelation, Mormons see the inevitable result as “philosophies of man, mingled with scripture”.
On the 7 June 2010 episode of "Raw," Gabriel and the other season one "NXT" rookies turned heel (villainous) by interfering in the Viewer's Choice main event match between John Cena and CM Punk, attacking both competitors, the announcing team and Justin Roberts, the ring announcer before dismantling the ring area and surrounding equipment.
Mormons again point to the Bible to show that after every period of apostasy, God always eventually called another prophet when the time was right.
The following week on "Raw," the rookies (excluding Daniel Bryan who had been released) attacked General Manager Bret Hart, when he refused to give them contracts.
It is in that same spirit that Mormons claim that once conditions were ready, God again resumed his pattern of revealing his will through prophets by calling Joseph Smith, through whom he restored the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, clearing up the error that had been introduced during the Great Apostasy.
At the Fatal 4-Way pay-per-view, the seven rookies interfered in the WWE Championship match and cost Cena the championship.
Mormons believe that since that time, revelation through prophets and apostles has continued unbroken until the present day, God having promised that revelation will not be taken again from the earth before the Second Coming of Christ.
The following week on "Raw," Vince McMahon fired Hart and announced the hiring of a new General Manager, who had signed the seven season one "NXT" rookies to contracts.
The Community of Christ (Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints), the second largest Latter Day Saint denomination, regularly canonizes revelation into the Doctrine and Covenants.
The following week, the group was named The Nexus.
If the conference confirms the Words of Counsel as prophetic, it is added as a Section in the scripture known as Doctrine and Covenants.
On the 12 July episode of "Raw", The Nexus competed in their first match together, without Darren Young, a six–on–one handicap match against John Cena, which they won when Gabriel pinned Cena.
Ahmadi Muslims believe that while law-bearing revelation has ended with the perfection of scripture in the form of the Qur'an, non-scriptural revelation to non-prophets as well as non law-bearing Muslim prophets continues.
The Nexus continued to feud with Cena and the Raw roster, resulting in a seven-on-seven elimination tag team match at SummerSlam.
They cite Qur'anic verses as well as Ahadith considered by many to be authentic in support of their belief in continuous revelation.
Gabriel was one of the final two Nexus members in the match, but Cena's team won when Cena eliminated Gabriel and then Barrett to win the match.
Progressive revelation is a core teaching in the Bahá'í Faith that suggests that religious truth is revealed by God progressively and cyclically over time through a series of divine Messengers, and that the teachings are tailored to suit the needs of the time and place of their appearance.
On 3 October 2010, Cena was forced to join The Nexus as a result of losing to Barrett at Hell in a Cell and at the following pay-per-view, Cena and Otunga won the WWE Tag Team Championship.
Thus, the Bahá'í teachings recognize the divine origin of several world religions as different stages of in the history of one religion, while believing that the revelation of Bahá'u'lláh is the most recent (though not the last—that there will never be a last), and therefore the most relevant to modern society.
On the 25 October 2010 episode of "Raw," Barrett made a tag team match, with Gabriel and Heath Slater facing Otunga and Cena for the championship.
Bahá'ís believe God to be generally regular and periodic in revealing His will to mankind through messengers/prophets, which are named Manifestations of God.
Gabriel and Slater won when Barrett ordered Otunga to allow Slater to pin him, becoming the new Tag Team Champions.
Each messenger in turn establishes a covenant and founds a religion.
Gabriel and Slater held the championship for nearly two months before losing it to Santino Marella and Vladimir Kozlov in a four-way elimination match, also involving The Usos and Mark Henry and Yoshi Tatsu on 6 December.
This process of revelation, according to the Bahá'í writings, is also never ceasing.
Gabriel and Slater received a rematch for the championship at on 19 December, but lost by disqualification when Nexus member Michael McGillicutty interfered.
The general theme of the successive and continuous religions founded by Manifestations of God is that there is an evolutionary tendency, and that each Manifestation of God brings a larger measure of revelation (or religion) to humankind than the previous one.
On the 10 January 2011 episode of "Raw," Gabriel and Slater refused to take part in new Nexus leader CM Punk's initiation and walked away from the group.
The differences in the revelation brought by the Manifestations of God is stated to be not inherent in the characteristics of the Manifestation of God, but instead attributed to the various worldly, societal and human factors; these differences are in accordance with the "conditions" and "varying requirements of the age" and the "spiritual capacity" of humanity.
The following day, at the tapings of the 14 January 2011 episode of "SmackDown," Gabriel and Slater helped former leader Barrett and Ezekiel Jackson attack Big Show.
Thus religious truth is seen to be relative to its recipients and not absolute; while the messengers proclaimed eternal moral and spiritual truths that are renewed by each messenger, they also changed their message to reflect the particular spiritual and material evolution of humanity at the time of the appearance of the messenger.
The following week, Gabriel, Slater, Barrett, and Jackson announced they had formed The Corre, and later that night Gabriel defeated World Heavyweight Champion Edge in a non-title match, following interference from the other members of The Corre.
In the Bahá'í view, since humanity's spiritual capacity and receptivity has increased over time, the extant to which these spiritual truths are expounded changes.
After winning a non-title match against the champions Kozlov and Marella on 4 February episode of "SmackDown", Gabriel and Slater received a match for the WWE Tag Team Championship two weeks later, but lost via disqualification when the other members of The Corre interfered.
In various designated offshoots of Taoism like the De Schools in Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong, and the Dao Schools in Hong Kong, Taiwan and China, weekly or sometimes monthly gatherings are held at temples to receive and understand communications from above by way of two mediums holding rattan sifts writing on sand, who are 'dictated' with news ranging in contents from current affairs, religion, to arts and morality, the writings are called Sift Text or '乩文'.
They received a rematch at the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view on 20 February and defeated Marella and Kozlov to win the WWE Tag Team Championship for the second time.
Different gods in the Daoist pantheon are designated for temples which have to go through the rigour of acceptance before the contents are recognized as authorized communiques from heaven.
The following night on "Raw", Gabriel and Slater lost the championship to John Cena and The Miz, but won the championship back minutes later after Barrett invoked The Corre's rematch clause, and The Miz turned on Cena.
It was renamed in 2003 amid the restructuring of districts and counties in Huizhou.
During this time, The Corre had continued to feud with The Big Show, and at WrestleMania XXVII in April the team of The Big Show, Kane, Santino Marella, and Kofi Kingston defeated The Corre.
Formerly named Huiyang city (county level), its size shrank after the restructuring with several towns incorporated into the Huicheng district of Huizhou.
At the 19 April taping of "SmackDown", the duo of Gabriel and Slater lost the Tag Team Championship to the team of Kane and The Big Show.
Qualifying for the 2010 FIBA World Championship in Turkey commenced as early as 2007 and will culminate in the five continental championships in each of the five FIBA zones.
In a backstage segment following the match, Gabriel was attacked by Slater, who thought Gabriel blamed him for their loss.
The final ranking of each continental championship determines which teams go to Turkey for the world championship, with FIBA allocating slots partly based on a zone's strength.
On the 6 May episode of "SmackDown", Gabriel, Barrett, and Slater attacked Jackson, removing him from the group.
In addition to the host, the gold medalists in the 2008 Olympic basketball championship are also allocated automatic berths to the championship.
The three remaining members of The Corre feuded with Jackson until the 10 June episode of "SmackDown", when Barrett walked out on Gabriel and Slater during a six-man tag team match against Jackson and the Usos, causing Gabriel and Slater to proclaim the end of The Corre.
Teams that failed to crack the top positions in their respective continental championships may still be selected as wild cards to fill out the 24-team cast.
Gabriel continued to ally himself with Slater despite the dissolution of The Corre, and the duo began a feud with The Usos.
A total of 106 countries participated in qualification to the world championship.
On the 17 June episode of "SmackDown", Gabriel and Slater were defeated by The Usos, but defeated them in a rematch the following week.
The USA also received an automatic berth for winning the 2008 Olympic Men's Basketball Tournament.
They were again defeated by The Usos on the 8 July episode of "SmackDown", resulting in the pair arguing in the ring.
Eighteen other teams qualified through continental qualifying tournaments, and FIBA invited four more "wild card" teams to fill out the 24-team field.
The following week, their team was ended when they faced off in a match won by Gabriel and Gabriel transitioned to a face (fan favourite) character.
Each FIBA zone is allocated a certain amount of automatic berths based upon the strength of its zone: the weakest zone, Oceania, gets only two automatic berths each, while Europe gets six.
At Money in the Bank, Gabriel participated in the SmackDown Money in the Bank ladder match, which was won by Daniel Bryan.
Certain peculiarities include:
For the rest of 2011, Gabriel scored many wins on "Superstars" over wrestlers like Tyson Kidd, JTG and Jinder Mahal, but was not as successful on other shows.
Qualifying tournaments:
On "Raw", he failed to win a battle royal for the WWE Intercontinental Championship on 26 September 2011; while on "SmackDown", he lost singles matches to Wade Barrett, Hunico and Cody Rhodes.
La Guiannée (or La Guignolée) is celebrated on December 31 (New Year's Eve)
In January 2012, Gabriel began an alliance of sorts with Hornswoggle, saving him from Slater and Cody Rhodes, leading to matches with both which he won and lost respectively.
It is a French medieval New Year's Eve tradition that is still practiced in two towns in the United States.
At Elimination Chamber, Gabriel unsuccessfully challenged Jack Swagger for the WWE United States Championship.
The tradition related to poor people being able to ask the more wealthy for food and drink at the celebrations of winter.
Following a series of matches in early 2012, Gabriel and Tyson Kidd showed mutual respect for each other, and decided to team up and form a tag team to challenge Primo & Epico for the WWE Tag Team Championship.
Customarily a troupe of traveling male singers went from door to door to entertain and ring in the new year.
In a dark match at WrestleMania XXVIII on 1 April, also involving the Usos, they attempted to win the championship but were unsuccessful.
Hosts were expected to give them food and drink.
During the match, Gabriel suffered a hyperextended and twisted elbow, rendering him inactive for several weeks.
Other sources say the young men were seeking donations for Twelfth Night.
He returned on the 30 May episode of "NXT", scoring the win for himself, Derrick Bateman and Percy Watson over the team of JTG, Johnny Curtis and Michael McGillicutty.
Begun as a way for the poor to be given gratuities by the rich, it also became a community social event for young men to visit with the families of young women.
Gabriel reunited with Kidd on 6 June, when they defeated Johnny Curtis and Heath Slater on "NXT Redemption".
Over time, the practice became an occasion for visiting with relatives and friends and was more or less a traveling feast.
At the No Way Out pay-per-view, Gabriel and Kidd were defeated by The Prime Time Players (Titus O'Neil and Darren Young) in a number one contender four-way tag team match, also involving Primo and Epico and The Usos.
At first it was carried on only by young men, often in costume; women joined the party in the 20th century.
When NXT merged with WWE's developmental territory FCW in August, Gabriel participated in a tournament to determine the inaugural NXT Champion, but was eliminated by Michael McGillicutty.
In many years, the people appeared in disguise, as part of the celebration was a kind of overturning of the common order.
On the 31 August episode of "SmackDown", Kidd and Gabriel suffered their first loss as a team against the Prime Time Players.
This tradition has been practiced annually since 1722 in Prairie du Rocher, Illinois.
On the debut episode of "Main Event" on 3 October, the pair, now unofficially called International Airstrike, lost to Santino Marella and Zack Ryder in the quarter-finals of a tournament to decide the number one contenders.
It has been revived in Ste. Genevieve, Missouri.
The following month, they were named part of a team for Survivor Series, and were on the winning side of a precursor match on 12 November when they, Rey Mysterio, and Sin Cara defeated the Prime Time Players, Primo, and Epico with Gabriel pinning Young.
Both were former French colonial villages settled by French Canadians in the eighteenth century.
At Survivor Series, Gabriel and Kidd were part of the victorious team in a five-on-five elimination tag team match, alongside Mysterio, Sin Cara, and Brodus Clay.
In the latter town, current celebrations feature singers and musicians, attired in colonial dress, who begin their night's journey at the local American Legion Hall.
In January 2013, Kidd had suffered a torn knee meniscus, placing their partnership on hold.
They make their way through all the restaurants, bars, nursing homes and high school gyms, ending at midnight at the Knights of Columbus Hall.
On the 17 April 2013 episode of "Main Event", Gabriel won a battle royal to earn a recognition for the #1 contender for the Intercontinental Championship.
He began training in track and sumo wrestling as a child.

Paestum Airfield is an abandoned World War II military airfield in Italy, located approximately 9 km north-northeast of Agropoli, in the province of Salerno, in the Campania region of Italy.
Lloyd has competed in numerous modeling contests.
It was an all-weather temporary field built by the United States Army Air Force XII Engineer Command using a graded earth compacted surface, with a prefabricated hessian (burlap) surfacing known as PHS.
He placed first in the Male Fitness Model Search held by FAME SA, sixth in the 2008 Mr Body Classic contest held by Mr & Ms Body Beautiful SA, eighth in the 2007 Men's Model Search held by Mr & Ms Fitness SA, and reached the top five in the Mr Physique Division in the 2008 Men's Model Search.
PHS was made of an asphalt-impregnated jute which was rolled out over the compacted surface over a square mesh track (SMT) grid of wire joined in 3-inch squares.
Lloyd appeared on Discovery Channel's "Shark After Dark" television program in August 2013.
In addition, tents were used for billeting and also for support facilities; an access road was built to the existing road infrastructure; a dump for supplies, ammunition, and gasoline drums, along with a drinkable water and minimal electrical grid for communications and station lighting.
In September 2013, he was featured on an episode of "Total Divas" as a love interest for JoJo.
Once completed it was turned over for use by the Twelfth Air Force 33d Fighter Group which operated P-40 Warhawks from the field between 13 September-18 November 1943, supporting ground forces as they advanced and attacking enemy aircraft on the air and ground.

After the 340th moved out the airfield was dismantled.
Lloyd has a degree in sports science he got in the United Kingdom.
Today, there are no remaining traces of the airfield as the area around the town of Paestum are heavily farmed and the agricultural use has obliterated any trace of the airfield.
Although he was born in Cape Town he resides in Pierre.
It is unknown precisely where the airfield was actually located due to the changed landscape over the past 60 years.

Barber was born in London.
Shattered Trust: The Shari Karney Story is a 1993 American made-for-television drama film directed by Bill Corcoran.
He studied graphic design at St Martins School of Art, where he graduated in 1988.
The film, which is based upon the true story of Shari Karney, garnered generally positive reviews.
He subsequently joined the TV department at Lambie-Naim & Co, where he designed and directed title sequences, including those for the BBC Nine O'Clock News.
However, it was criticized for exploiting a real incest case for entertainment use.
In 1991, he completed new identities for BBC1 and BBC2, for which he won a BAFTA and a D&AD award.
Situated in the early 1980s, Shari Karney is a successful attorney, assigned to an incest case, involving a three-year-old girl, Christie, who is being molested by her father.
In 1993, he joined Rose Hackney Productions where he directed commercials full-time.
She initially refuses to take the case, explaining that she isn't familiar with cases involving sexual abuse.
His work was showcased at the Cannes International Advertising Festival and in 1994, he was named as a Creative Face of the Future by Campaign magazine and as one of the UK's "Hotshot" commercial directors.
She is later convinced by the child's mother, Darlene Holland, but the trial proves to be difficult.
He has won dozens of awards for his commercials both in Europe and The United States of America.
Nine months later, she is heavily invested in the case, which involves her private life.
In 2003, his work was also included in the top ten of Channel 4's "100 Greatest Commercials".
She has trouble sleeping at night and is often bothered by flashbacks of her own past.
In 2006, Barber became a partner at London-based film production company Knucklehead, where he continues to direct commercials.
Whenever she tries to make love with her boyfriend Mark, she suffers panic attacks.
His most recent work includes commercials for Adidas, Audi, The BBC, Estee Lauder, Sony, BMW, Orange, O2, Hewlett Packard, SAP, DHL and the Royal Air Force.
She eventually attacks David Holland, the man charged, in the courtroom and is therefore sent to jail for two days.
Barber's first film was "The Tonto Woman", a 35-minute western based on a short story by Elmore Leonard.
Shari fears she has ruined the case, but Darlene insists on holding her as her lawyer.
The film is about a cattle rustler who becomes involved in the life of a woman who has been held captive by Mojave Indians for the past 11 years and is now living in isolation.
The judge, however, puts her on probation and forces her to seek psychological help.
The film won Best Film at Palm Springs 2007, Best of Festival at LA Shorts 2008 and was nominated for an Oscar in 2008.
She contacts psychiatrist Joan Delvecchio and admits to her that she is constantly hearing typing sounds.
Following "The Tonto Woman", Barber directed his first full-length feature, "Harry Brown" starring Michael Caine, who plays a widowed ex-marine whose retirement is disrupted when a gang of vicious thugs take over his neighbourhood and murder his best friend.
She reveals that as a child she was physically abused by her mother, and that her father had done nothing to protect her.
Described as a modern urban western, it reflects the stark realities of youth crime in the 21st century.
Her sister Linda thinks therapy would be good for her, explaining that there must be a reason that she never wore make-up and always wore baggy clothes.
It had its World Premiere as a Special Presentation at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival and was received with standing ovations.
At court, David is prohibited from seeing his daughter for six months.
The film was released theatrically on 11 November 2009 at the Odeon Leicester Square.
Shari is furious that thereafter, he is allowed to see her again, claiming that he then will keep on raping her.
Born in The Hague, Netherlands, he was christened James Washington, but officially named Jacobus Washington.
Meanwhile, in therapy, Joan notices that Shari shows the same symptoms as rape victims, but thinks it could be explained by her fathers's abuse.
Most of his adult life was shaped by his participation in wars for and against Napoleonic France and his service to Ludwig I of Bavaria.
When Mark finds out she has taken another incest case, he leaves her.
The known history of the Washington family goes back to the 12th century.
She turns to her parents, but her mother blames her for having driven Mark away.
Sir Robert Washington (d. 1324) was the progenitor of the branch of the family residing in Sulgrave Manor, England.
Her therapist makes her write a letter to her mother.
One of his descendants, John Washington, emigrated to Virginia in 1656 and was the great-grandfather of George Washington.
When writing, not only does she express the hatred she feels for her mother, but also reveals that she is an incest victim herself, having been abused by her father for years.
The brother of Sir Robert, Sir John Washington (d. 1331), founded the Hallhead Hall/Adwick-le-street branch of the Washingtons.
She starts to remember everything and finds out that she buried the abuse so deep that she didn't consciously remember it.
His descendant, James Washington, accompanied John Washington to Virginia, but returned to England, then shortly thereafter emigrated to Rotterdam, the Netherlands.
In sessions, Joan helps her remember the entire truth and eventually Shari tells that her father raped her after typing, which explains the sounds of typing she heard.
There he married a Dutchwoman named Clara van der Lauen, leading, five generations later, to Jacobus Washington.
She confronts her parents, but they respond with outrage, claiming they will never forgive her for the accusation.
On February 2, 1777, Daniel Washington, aged 46 and a military solicitor, married Elisabeth Cornelia Hoogstad.
Linda refuses to believe her as well and has trouble even accepting the possibility.
Jacobus was born on January 26, 1778.
At work, her new client withdraws and Christie is hospitalized.
His only sibling, Daniel, was born July 27, 1781.
Frustrated, she is determined to change the law, allowing incest victims to sue their parents whenever they want to, without a statute of limitations.
Their father died in October 1786, and their mother in September 1789, leaving them orphaned at 11 and 8 years old.
She contacts Stephanie Chadford, another lawyer who tried to change the incest law.
Little is known of their lives for some years after.
This requires her to step to the media, telling her own story.
Daniel remained in the Netherlands, married in 1808, and died in 1813, apparently without children.
She is immediately estranged from her sister and disowned by her parents.
In 1794, aged 16, Jacobus Washington joined the Dutch Army.
Meanwhile, the process of changing a law proves to be exhausting, taking up to six years to even qualify in court, and her emotional involvement upsets her partners, who eventually fire her.
When the French invaded later that year he fought against them.
In the end, however, the law changes, with Shari's help.
In 1799, in a letter to George Washington, Jacobus offered his services to the United States in its undeclared Quasi-War with France, but was turned down due to his inexperience.
Parts of the film were shot in Salt Lake City, Utah.
He then moved to the Kingdom of Bavaria, where he joined the Bavarian Army.
The National Party was a minor political party in the Irish Free State between 1924 and 1925.
He came to the attention of Crown Prince Ludwig, who made Jakob his adjutant.
It was a splinter group of nine Cumann na nGaedheal TDs led by Joseph McGrath, who had been Minister for Industry and Commerce in the Cumann na nGaedheal government.
In July 1807 Jakob was present at the negotiations for the Treaties of Tilsit following the victory of the French Empire (of which Bavaria was now an ally) over Russia.
McGrath founded the National Party in the aftermath of the Army Mutiny, the last military challenge to civilian authority in Ireland.
Over the next few years he advanced to the rank of Colonel.
The nine TDs protested the refusal of the government to reinstate mutineers among the officer corps in October 1924.
In October 1813, Bavaria joined the Allies against France.
They were also impatient with progress towards a united 32-county Republic.
On June 7, 1815 in Brussels, Jakob Washington signed a treaty with the Duke of Wellington representing Bavaria.
The nine resigned their seats to run in simultaneous by-elections in March 1925, described as a "mini-general election", as a test of public opinion and sympathy with the mutiny.
He fought in the Battle of Waterloo, the only Bavarian officer to do so, since the rest of the Bavarians were held in reserve in Saarbrücken.
Seven of the polls were won by Cumann na nGaedheal; the other two were won by the abstentionist candidates of Sinn Féin, then led by Éamon de Valera.
In 1825, Ludwig became King of Bavaria as Ludwig I. Washington's career continued apace, rising eventually to Lieutenant General.
Sunkist is a brand of primarily orange flavored soft drinks launched in 1979.
Ludwig also appointed him Grand Chamberlain and Marshal of his military household.
Sunkist was first licensed by Sunkist Growers to the General Cinema Corporation, the leading independent bottler of Pepsi-Cola products at the time.
In 1843, on a visit to London, Queen Victoria dubbed him a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath.
The soft drink was the idea of Mark Stevens, who foresaw the potential based on market research which indicated that, worldwide, orange was the third best selling soft drink flavor (largely due to The Coca-Cola Company's Fanta brand).
Jakob's first wife was baroness Antonie van Löchner (born Baroness von Verger) (1788–1830), a wealthy widow.
After extensive R&D during 1977 and early 1978, in which research was conducted on taste, color and carbonation levels, Sunkist made a grand introduction in New York by franchising it to The Coca-Cola Bottling Company of New York City, where Edward F. O'Reilly was president.
After her death, he married baroness Caroline Segesser von Brunegg (1802–1841) in 1833.
At the time of introduction, Sunkist Soft Drinks had only five key employees: Mark Stevens, President; Peter Murphy, VP Sales; Dr. John Leffingwell, VP R&D; Ray Sissom, VP Finance; and Jim DeDreu, NE Regional Manager.
Through this marriage he gained the Castle Notzing, near the town of Erding, Bavaria.
It went national soon thereafter by being franchised mainly to leading Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola bottlers.
Baron Jakob von Washington died in Notzing on April 5, 1848.
The advertising slogan was "fun, sun and the beach" using TV and radio commercials with the Beach Boys' hit song "Good Vibrations" as the brand's theme.
Maximilian Emanuel also became Grand Chamberlain, married Duchess Frederica of Oldenburg (sister of Queen Amalia of Greece), and had two sons, one of whom, named George, served in the 11th Hussars of the Austro-Hungarian army reaching the rank of captain.
In 1980, Sunkist Orange Soda became the #1 orange soda in the USA and the 10th best selling soft drink.
However, despite reports to the contrary, he did not fight during the First World War, having retired before the War started.
Unlike many other competing orange sodas, Sunkist contains caffeine (41.0mg).
Both sons died without issue, and since none of Jakob's other children had any offspring, the von Washington line became extinct.
In 2010, there was a consumer recall after a batch was accidentally mixed with 6 times amount of the caffeine, sickening consumers.
Leonard Francis McAllister Jr. (born January 13, 1972) is a libertarian American political commentator for a number of newspapers and websites, including AOL and The Root.
In late 1984, Sunkist Soft Drinks was sold to Del Monte.
McAllister was born Leonard Francis McAllister, Jr. on January 13, 1972 in Pittsburgh to parents Leonard, Sr. and Carol McAllister.
From late 1986 until 2008, it was produced by Cadbury Schweppes under license through its Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages subsidiary.
Both he and his mother almost died during childbirth.
Following the demerger of Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages from Cadbury Schweppes, it is now produced by Keurig Dr Pepper in the USA.
McAllister grew up in the Penn Hills, a suburb outside Pittsburgh.
Sunkist is still the most popular orange soda in the United States.
His father was a computer technician and an electrician for a local steel mill, and his mother ran a daycare out of the family home before her death in 2006.
Sunkist (as a carbonated soft drink) is sold in the UK by Vimto Soft Drinks under license from Sunkist Growers.
McAllister attended middle school at St. Bart's School, playing football and basketball.
It is also sold in Australia by Schweppes Australia (a subsidiary of Asahi Breweries), but the Australian formulation is caffeine free.
Always undersized, McAllister quarterbacked the school's 14-and-under football team to a championship as an 11-year-old.
In Canada, a caffeine free version of the orange drink is marketed as C'Plus.
He then attended Central Catholic High School for a few years before leaving to take a scholarship to Shady Side Academy.
The package indicates that there is a small amount of Sunkist Juice.
He graduated from Shady Side in 1989, earning scholarship offers to several universities.
In the Philippines, it was sold by Cosmos Bottling until 2001, when San Miguel Corporation acquired Cosmos and sold its brands to Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc.
In 1989, McAllister enrolled at Davidson College, on "the 13-year path to a four-year degree".
As of 2013, Sunkist is sold by Asia Brewery.
He was slated to walk-on the Davidson basketball team as a freshman but declined after coach Bobby Hussey left Davidson after the 1988–1989 school year.
Keurig Dr Pepper makes a variety of Sunkist flavors.
He left school in 1992 for a sabbatical that lasted a decade.
In addition to Orange, there is Diet Orange, Grape, Strawberry, Cherry Limeade, Pineapple, Lemonade, Diet Lemonade, Peach, Fruit Punch, Pink Lemonade, and Strawberry Lemonade.
Before leaving that spring, he contributed a piece on Black History Month to the school paper "The Davidsonian", receiving numerous anonymous threats, including isolated death threats.
The Ethiopia Commodity Exchange (ECX) is a commodities exchange established April 2008 in Ethiopia.
McAllister dropped out of college for a decade and became a father at age 21 with the first of his two children.
In Proclamation 2007-550, which created the ECX, its stated objective was "to ensure the development of an efficient modern trading system" that would "protect the rights and benefits of sellers, buyers, intermediaries, and the general public."
In 2000, McAllister re-enrolled at Davidson College, graduating with a history degree in 2002.
The ECX is set up as a private company owned by a partnership of the market actors, members of the exchange, and the Ethiopian government, led by Eleni Gebre Medhin a former economist for the International Food Policy Research Institute and the World Bank.
In 2005, McAllister ran for office in Davidson, North Carolina, losing as the only Republican against an all-Democrat slate by only 56 votes.
As of July 2011, the physical presence of the ECX consists of 55 warehouses in 17 regional locations.
In 2007, he ran and lost another close race, after McAllister was slated to win one of five seats in non-official polling.
It has grown from trading 138,000 tons in its first year to 508,000 tons in its third year, with nearly equal shares of coffee and oilseeds and pulses.
In July 2008, he was featured in a series of commercials on Black Entertainment Television regarding the upcoming election.
The value of the ECX rose 368% between 2010 and 2011 to reach US$1.1 billion.
Soon after, Fox Charlotte cast him as their political contributor during the 2008 campaign.
As of November 2010, the trading floor in Addis Ababa handled 200 spot contracts in commodities such as coffee, sesame, navy beans, maize and wheat.
McAllister provided live commentary during question-and-answer sessions and live editorials weekly on the "Fox News Rising" morning show, the Charlotte morning show.
It was assessed in July 2011 that membership equaled 243 with clients, who trade through members, about 7,800.
McAllister attended the 2008 Republican National Convention representing Hip Hop Republicans, and provided commentary on CNN, Fox Charlotte, XM Radio, and BET, as well as webcasts on Washington Post and Fox.
Farmer cooperatives represented 2.4 millions smallholder farmers, which make up 12% of the membership.
On CNN American Morning, he gave a critical view of the approach to the Governor Sarah Palin VP introduction to America, saying that her daughter’s pregnancy was an opportunity to make a connection to everyday Americans instead of trying to portray the Palins as perfect.
Currently, the ECX is the only stock or commodity exchange in Africa to have streamlined payment transfers down to "T+1" (ext day payment after a trade) from its clearinghouse to its partner commercial banks.
In March 2013, he ran as a candidate in the Republican primary for Illinois's 2nd congressional district special election, but lost.
Market data reach is expansive.

In physical rehabilitation and sports training, the SAID principle asserts that the human body adapts specifically to imposed demands.
The first year of the Ethiopia Commodity Exchange's existence is documented in the PBS Wide Angle film "The Market Maker".
In other words, given stressors on the human system, whether biomechanical or neurological, there will be a "Specific Adaptation to Imposed Demands" (SAID).
David D'Antoni (born 28 January 1979) is an Italian footballer who played over 150 games at Italian Serie B.
For example, by only doing pull-ups on the same regular pull-up bar, your body becomes adapted to this specific physical demand, but not necessarily adapted to other climbing patterns or environments.
Born in Viterbo, Lazio, D'Antoni played for Ladispoli at Serie D in Lazio region.
In 1958, Berkeley Professor of Physical Education Franklin M. Henry proposed the "Specificity Hypothesis of Motor Learning".
He then signed by Empoli and made debut in Serie A on 25 October 1998 against U.C. Sampdoria.
It is found in eastern North Carolina, Louisiana and Florida.
He then played at Serie C2 clubs and won promotion with Vis Pesaro.
Adults have been found from April to September in North Carolina, suggesting the species breeds continuously and likely has three or four generations per year.
He then played for Salernitana, Cesena, Genoa and Venezia.
Lewisia nevadensis is a species of flowering plant in the Montiaceae family known by the common name Nevada lewisia.
In January 2005, he joined current club Frosinone.
It is native to much of the western United States, where it grows in moist mountain habitat, such as meadows.
Morey Mansion is an 1890 Victorian house in Redlands, California, United States.
This is a small perennial herb growing from a taproot and caudex unit.
The house was built in 1890 by early Redlands residents David and Sarah Morey for $20,000, profits from the sale of their citrus nursery.
It produces a basal rosette of several narrow, fingerlike to threadlike fleshy leaves up to 13 centimeters long.
Following the Moreys' deaths in 1901, the house's second owners were Willard R. and Nancy Cheney, the brother and sister-in-law of Helen Cheney Kimberly, who was the wife of one of the founders of Kimberly-Clark Corporation.
The inflorescence is a bundle of short stems a few centimeters tall each bearing a flower.
In the 1940s, it was reportedly owned by actress Carole Lombard's uncle and left to her in his will, but she died before she could take ownership.
The flower has 5 to 10 shiny white to pale pink petals each 1 to 2 centimeters long, pointed or with blunt tips.
Shortly after, the mansion was purchased by Willard M. and Florence Wiseman, and then sold in 1969 to Curtiss and Phyllis Allen.
This is sometimes grown as an ornamental plant suitable for alpine and rock gardens.
The Allens owned it during the 1970s.
A Catskill Eagle is the 12th Spenser novel by Robert B. Parker, first published in 1985.
Mr. Allen had seen the house as a young boy while in Redlands; he told someone that he was going to own that house one day.
The title comes from a quote from Herman Melville.
A friend told him it was for sale and Mr. Allen purchased it immediately.
Spenser receives a letter from his lover, Susan Silverman, who has relocated to the West Coast.
The house was featured in the film "Talk About a Stranger" (1952) as the house of the character Dr. Paul Mahler, alias Matlock.
His friend and associate, Hawk, is in jail and she needs help.
The mansion opened as the first bed and breakfast in Redlands in 1985 under then-owners Carl Ljungquist and Gary Conway.
Susan Silverman, in an effort to discover her own identity, has moved to the West Coast.
The house was purchased by Janet Cosgrove in 1998, who oversaw renovation work to the building before reopening it as a bed and breakfast in 2006.
There she engages a relationship with a wealthy heir, Russell Costigan.
In 2010, Sara and Bill Taylor bought the mansion for sole use as their private residence.
The story begins with her letter.
In 2012 the house went into foreclosure.
Spenser flies to San Francisco, California after making preparations to break Hawk out of jail using a gun hidden in the bottom of a fake leg cast.
In January 2014, ownership was returned to Janet Cosgrove.
Spenser and Hawk then have to deal with a man rich enough to do anything he wants, legal or not.
Meindert Leerling (born 11 January 1936 in Heerjansdam) is a Dutch former politician, television director and (sports) journalist.
Spenser and Hawk follow Russell's trail across the country in an attempt to locate Susan and reunite her with Spenser.
As a member of the Reformatory Political Federation (Reformatorische Politieke Federatie) he was a member of the Dutch House of Representatives as well as Parliamentary leader from 1981 to 1994.
The book climaxes with a deadly encounter deep in an underground shelter between Spenser and the Costigans.
Previously he worked as a television director and RTV journalist for the Evangelical Broadcasting (Evangelische Omroep) and as a sports journalist for several newspapers.
The school served fifth and sixth graders.
Meindert Leerling has been married twice (his first wife died in 1999) and is a member of the Protestant Church in the Netherlands (PKN).
In the spring of 2013, Chapman Intermediate School was closed, as it was no longer needed.
Liberty Downtown Historic District is a historic district located at Liberty in Sullivan County, New York.
Students who would have attended it now attend one of the four feeder elementary schools until fifth grade, and then attend E.T. Booth Middle School in sixth grade.
The district includes 112 contributing buildings and comprises the village's commercial core.
Chapman opened in 2000 with approximately 1150 fifth and sixth grade students and a staff of almost 100.
It subsumes the Liberty Village Historic District listed in 1978, which had 12 contributing buildings.
Until 1935, there was a small school located across from Bascomb Church on what is now Bascomb-Carmel Road.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 and 2006.
It consisted of grades one through seven.
Allan Bérubé (1946–2007) helped to establish the enlarged historic district.
In 1935, Bascomb School was consolidated with another elementary school and was later torn down.
Continuous revelation or continuing revelation is a theological belief or position that God continues to reveal divine principles or commandments to humanity.
South Cherokee County remained a rural area into the mid-1960s.
In Christian traditions, it is most commonly associated with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), and with Pentecostal and Charismatic Christianity, though it is found in some other denominations as well.
Highway 92 was paved in 1962.
Continuous revelation also forms part of the rituals of gatherings in various chapters of Taoism.
Until that time it had been an all-weather graveled road and was known as the Old Alabama Road.
In the Baha'i Faith, Progressive revelation is an important concept that is similar to continuous revelation.
Around this time, south Cherokee County began growing by leaps and bounds.
A notable factor of continuous or continuing revelation as a source of divine commandments and statements is the written recording of such statements in a more open scriptural canon, as is the case with the Latter-Day Saints; while more frequent with the Latter-Day Saints, it is less frequent with the Baha'i Faith, with progressive revelation only being periodically expanded over an extremely long period.
People began moving to the area and driving to work in Atlanta.
Conservative Judaism teaches God's revelation at Mount Sinai and God's continuing revelation through study of Jewish texts and through life as a Jewish believer.
Rooms and buildings were added, only to be outgrown before they were completed.
Vatican II states “no new public revelation is to be expected before the glorious manifestation of our Lord, Jesus Christ.”
The property of the Chapman family was purchased for the new school.
The notion of progressive or continuing revelation is not held by the Roman Catholic Church or by Eastern Orthodoxy, who instead favor the idea of tradition and development of doctrine, while progressivist and continuationist approaches are specifically condemned in the declaration Dominus Iesus.
Construction was begun in 1971 and completed in February 1974.
Protestants generally teach that the modern age is not a period of continuing revelation.
From August 1973 until February 1974, the Chapman faculty and students were split and located at Woodstock and Oak Grove.
The Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) affirm continuing revelation through the Inner light or the light within, which is the presence of God which provides illumination and guidance to the individual and through individuals to the group.
The school opened with grades one through eight.
Some Friends consider the Bible the ultimate authority, but others consider the Inner Light to be above the Bible.
During the 1970s and 1980s, the area continued to grow and E.T. Booth Middle School was built and opened nearby.
Both groups believe that the Inner Light speaks to people directly and not just through the text of the Bible.
The seventh and eighth grade students from Chapman and other south Cherokee elementary schools were transferred to the new middle school.
Because Friends believe that revelation is ongoing, they have no set creed or dogmas.
A large two-story classroom building was added to the Chapman campus in 1990 to accommodate its ever-increasing enrollment.
However, as early Friends listened to the Inner light and endeavored to live accordingly, a common set of beliefs gradually emerged, which became known as testimonies.
During the 1998-1999 school year, once again some decisions were needed to make arrangements for the growing schools in the area.
Although rooted in the immediate experience of the community of Friends, these Testimonies are based on what Friends believe are verified in the Bible, especially as described in the Gospels regarding the life and teachings of Jesus.
With parent and faculty input, the decision was made to create a school for fifth and sixth grade students and to house this new school at the Chapman campus.
Pentecostal and Charismatic Christians generally believe that Christians, especially "Spirit-filled" Christians can receive revelations from God in the form of dreams, visions, and audible or inaudible voices.
Preparations were made to transition these students from Bascomb, Boston, and Oak Grove Elementaries.
They also believe that certain individuals are able to transmit revelations from God in the form of prophecy, words of knowledge, and speaking in tongues and interpretation of tongues.
In August 2000, Chapman Intermediate School opened with approximately 1150 fifth and sixth grade students and a staff of almost 100.
While most Pentecostals and Charismatics believe the Bible to be the ultimate authority and would not say that any new revelation can ever contradict the Bible, they do believe that God continues to speak to people today on extra-biblical topics as well as to interpret and apply the text of the Bible.
In 2011, the building of the new E.T. Booth Middle School began.
Mormonism makes a distinction between personal revelation and revelation directed to all members of the church.
This took sixth grade, and the elementary schools took fifth grade.
They believe that personal revelation can come to any individual with a righteous desire, for example to direct someone in their search for truth.
It is speculated that Chapman will become a ninth grade academy for Etowah High School.
In contrast, revelation for the entire church only comes to those who have been called by God as prophets, which in the LDS Church includes the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.
In January 2014, Chapman became Etowah East High School and featured some technology-based classes, such as AP Computer Science.
Mormons regard revelation through prophets as an indispensable element of Christ's church, without which the church would be led by man, not God.
In the 2014-2015 school year, Chapman's cafeteria opened to students traveling between Etowah High School and Etowah East.
Continued revelation is essential for matters affecting the church as a whole, including guiding the church through changing world conditions, keeping doctrine pure and unadulterated, revealing new doctrine and scripture in the times appointed by God, and making policy or organizational changes as the church grows and evolves.
As a result, all trailers at Etowah High were scheduled to be removed from campus at the end of the 2013-2014 school year.
In contrast to the Mainstream Christian belief that God has "sealed up the heavens" in terms of church-wide revelation, Mormons believe God continues to follow the pattern that he adhered to throughout the entire span of the Bible, which was to reveal his will and doctrine through prophets.
Ewbanks is located along a railroad line northeast of Quincy.
Mormons see the tendency to dismiss the possibility that God could call modern prophets as similar to the attitude of those in the Bible who rejected the prophets and/or apostles of their day.
It was previously known as "Eubanks".
As demonstrated by the Jews in the time of Jesus, it is often much less challenging to accept prophets of prior ages, rather than a contemporary prophet.
A post office called Eubanks was established in 1872, and remained in operation until 1895.
Granted, the work of a prophet has always been to dispel false beliefs and warn against behaviors that are contrary to God's will, which inevitably creates friction when viewed as a threat to firmly entrenched traditions and mindsets.
Winifred Carter (c. 1883–1949) was an English author and playwright, who was particularly active from the 1920s–40s ("not to be confused with Winifred S Carter, an American celebrity chef and cookery author also active from the 1920s–40s").
The sense of change in the message of Christ and the apostles led many to regard them as false prophets.
It is a romance set in 1783, which chronicles the convoluted, yet ultimately doomed, relationship between a prince regent and a Catholic widow.
Christ himself warned against false prophets, teaching that the way to distinguish between a true and a false prophet was "by their fruits" (Matt 7:15-20); however, the perceived threat to tradition was often a strong enough deterrent to cause the witnesses of good fruits (such as powerful sermons or miraculous healings) to dismiss them as the work of the devil (Matt 12:24).
Asterleigh, sometimes in the past called Esterley, is a farm and deserted medieval village about northeast of Charlbury in Oxfordshire.
After Christ ordained his apostles, he warned them of the extreme opposition they would encounter for these reasons, telling them, "ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake" (Matt 10:16-23).
Asterleigh's toponym indicates that it was created by woodland clearance on what would then have been the edge of Wychwood Forest.
Christ also said, “Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you!
The Domesday Book of 1086 does not record Asterleigh as a separate settlement.
For so did their fathers to the false prophets," thus illustrating that opposition will naturally accompany a true prophet if they are doing their job correctly (Luke 6:22-26).
Medieval pottery found in 1948 suggests that Asterleigh was inhabited by the 12th century.
Sometimes the opposition against God's prophets escalated to the point of violence and martyrdom, which Jesus and the apostles frequently referenced while preaching to their detractors (Matt 23:31-37, Luke 11:47-51, Acts 7:52, Romans 11:3, 1 Thes 2:15).
Also in 1948, squared stones were found along with limestone roofing slates that had medieval-style drilled nail-holes.
In this sense, Mormons acknowledge that revelation has not continued uninterrupted throughout history, being that the killing of God's prophets sometimes resulted in periods without church-wide revelation—which Mormons refer to as apostasies.
The earliest known documentary record of Asterleigh is from early in the 13th century.
Similar to prophets before them, Peter and the apostles also suffered martyrdom at the hands of their persecutors—with the exception of John who was banished to the Isle of Patmos.
However, the village declined and its landowning family decided to leave the village and move to Nether Kiddington.
In contrast to the Mainstream Christian view that the apostolic era came to a close because revelation had reached its completion, Mormons see it not as God's will but as a tragic result of the overwhelming persecution that plagued the church in that era, which cut short the program of apostolic succession that had commenced when Judas was replaced by Matthias (Acts 1:23-26).
In 1895 it was combined with the civil parish of Kiddington.
The apostasy that followed is referred to as the Great Apostasy, because it lasted longer than prior periods without prophets.
Azra Sherwani (1940–2005) was a Pakistani television actress with a career spanning over 35 years who played a variety of roles.
Mormons believe that once the Christian church was no longer led by revelation, its doctrine began to be altered by theologians who took it upon themselves to continue developing doctrine, despite not being called or authorized to receive revelation for the church body.
She began her career with the Rawalpindi Studios of PTV in the late 1960s.
In the absence of revelation, these theologians often resorted to speculation, which coupled with their own interpretations and extrapolations of scripture, inevitably resulted in disagreement and division on many doctrinal points.
Sherwani worked with some of the best producers in the country including Mohsin Ali, late Shereen Khan, late Shahzad Khalil, Sultana Siddiqui, Zaheer Khan and Sahira Kazmi.
Ecumenical councils were held in order to settle these differences, yet without prophets called and authorized to reveal God's will on the topics being debated, the attendees could only vote on the theories presented in order to decide which ones would become official doctrine—a practice that served to ostracize as heretics those who didn't go along with these decisions, and in some cases led to major schisms in the church.
She also worked with some of the best writers of her time including Fatima Surraiya Bajiya, Haseena Moin and Anwar Maqsood.
Mormons view this process of doctrinal development as completely foreign to God's established pattern of revealing doctrine through a prophet.
The role of Apa Begum in Haseena Moin's "Tanhaiyaan" was undoubtedly the most famous of her career where Shahzad Khalil cast her as a tough taskmaster who ill-treated her employee, Buqrat, played by Jamshed Ansari.
They point to history as incontrovertible proof that humans are incapable of agreeing on how to interpret the Bible (2 Pet 1:20), which should act as a strong indicator that God's purpose for the Bible was not to derive doctrine, but rather to support it.
She logically argued (and winning in the end, of course) with him as to why he should get bus fare when walking can improve his health and solve the problem.
When doctrine is not established and maintained through continued revelation, Mormons see the inevitable result as “philosophies of man, mingled with scripture”.
Her character wanted her brother (Qazi Wajid as Faran) to marry a dominant woman which, fortunately, does not happen.
Mormons again point to the Bible to show that after every period of apostasy, God always eventually called another prophet when the time was right.
As Ghazi Apa in "Uncle Urfi", she stood between the two love birds, quarrelled regularly with Hasnat Bhai (Jamshed Ansari again) and was the dominant force behind the extremely funny Shaheer Bhai (Qurban Jilani).
It is in that same spirit that Mormons claim that once conditions were ready, God again resumed his pattern of revealing his will through prophets by calling Joseph Smith, through whom he restored the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, clearing up the error that had been introduced during the Great Apostasy.
Azra played the selfish mother of Sitara (Atiqa Odho) in "Sitara Aur Mehr-un-nisa" and the despised mother-in-law aka Saliha Begum of Mahboob Ahmed (Shakeel) in "Aangan Terha" with Bushra Ansari and Saleem Nasir as Akbar, the live-in Man Friday with a passion for classical dance.
Mormons believe that since that time, revelation through prophets and apostles has continued unbroken until the present day, God having promised that revelation will not be taken again from the earth before the Second Coming of Christ.
Then she was the villainous Mai Jaina in "Mera Naam Mangu" in the early 1970s — a play about professional beggars — while she excelled in Haseena Moin's "Parchaiyaan" as part of a star cast comprising Rahat Kazmi, Sahira Kazmi, Shakeel and Talat Hussain.
The Community of Christ (Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints), the second largest Latter Day Saint denomination, regularly canonizes revelation into the Doctrine and Covenants.
She held her own in Bajiya's "Afshaan", with fellow cast members Shafi Mohammad, Shakeel, Qazi Wajid, Ishrat Hashmi and Begum Khurshid Mirza.
Its Prophet/President present Words of Council to the church usually before its World Conference.
In short, her histrionic talent set the standards for character acting on Pakistan television.
If the conference confirms the Words of Counsel as prophetic, it is added as a Section in the scripture known as Doctrine and Covenants.
Azra Sherwani worked with actors of all generations — from Qazi Wajid, Subhani Ba Yunus, Imtiaz Ahmed, Begum Khurshid Mirza, Qurban Jilani, Shakeel, Shafi Mohammad, Talat Iqbal, Anwar Maqsood, Akbar Subhan, Behroze Sabzwari, Shahnaz Sheikh, Marina Khan, Ishrat Hashmi, Jamshed Ansari, Babar Ali, Mazhar Ali, Mishi Khan, Atiqa Odho, Sania Saeed, Sajid Hasan and Sadia Imam.
Ahmadi Muslims believe that while law-bearing revelation has ended with the perfection of scripture in the form of the Qur'an, non-scriptural revelation to non-prophets as well as non law-bearing Muslim prophets continues.
When the advent of private productions brought about the decline of quality plays on PTV, Azra Sherwani sustained for some time, working in plays such as "Kanwal", Bajiya's "Ghar Ik Nagar" and Sultana Siddiqui's "Doosri Duniya".
They cite Qur'anic verses as well as Ahadith considered by many to be authentic in support of their belief in continuous revelation.
Her character was such that she quarrels with Qazi Wajid, a tenant in the house of Khala's folks who refuses to either leave or pay the rent.
Progressive revelation is a core teaching in the Bahá'í Faith that suggests that religious truth is revealed by God progressively and cyclically over time through a series of divine Messengers, and that the teachings are tailored to suit the needs of the time and place of their appearance.
Qazi Wajid, who worked with her the most from 1970s to 2000, said she was a sincere actress and an amazing friend with whom there was not a single moment of boredom.
Thus, the Bahá'í teachings recognize the divine origin of several world religions as different stages of in the history of one religion, while believing that the revelation of Bahá'u'lláh is the most recent (though not the last—that there will never be a last), and therefore the most relevant to modern society.
"We were waiting for her to pay us a visit since she was in the US with her son but instead, she bid farewell and left us all."
Bahá'ís believe God to be generally regular and periodic in revealing His will to mankind through messengers/prophets, which are named Manifestations of God.
Playwright Haseena Moin remembers her as an irreplaceable asset who always delivered the very best when it came to acting.
Each messenger in turn establishes a covenant and founds a religion.
On the set, she was Azra apa but when the camera rolled, she became the character she was playing and no one could say that she was the same person.
This process of revelation, according to the Bahá'í writings, is also never ceasing.
All her characters in my plays had shades of positive and negative characteristics and handling them was her forte.
The general theme of the successive and continuous religions founded by Manifestations of God is that there is an evolutionary tendency, and that each Manifestation of God brings a larger measure of revelation (or religion) to humankind than the previous one.
She was one of those people who acted for their love of acting and not because of money, which is quite opposite to the acting scenario right now.
The differences in the revelation brought by the Manifestations of God is stated to be not inherent in the characteristics of the Manifestation of God, but instead attributed to the various worldly, societal and human factors; these differences are in accordance with the "conditions" and "varying requirements of the age" and the "spiritual capacity" of humanity.
Getting an actress of her calibre is not only difficult but also impossible.
Thus religious truth is seen to be relative to its recipients and not absolute; while the messengers proclaimed eternal moral and spiritual truths that are renewed by each messenger, they also changed their message to reflect the particular spiritual and material evolution of humanity at the time of the appearance of the messenger.
The best thing about her was that she had no issues about her educated background as she easily donned the character of an aaya (Fazeelat) in Dhoop Kinaray while was also the rich begum sahiba (Apa Begum) in Tanhaiyaan."
In the Bahá'í view, since humanity's spiritual capacity and receptivity has increased over time, the extant to which these spiritual truths are expounded changes.
Badar Khalil was all praise and said she knew Azra Sherwani even before her marriage to Shahzad Khalil.
In various designated offshoots of Taoism like the De Schools in Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong, and the Dao Schools in Hong Kong, Taiwan and China, weekly or sometimes monthly gatherings are held at temples to receive and understand communications from above by way of two mediums holding rattan sifts writing on sand, who are 'dictated' with news ranging in contents from current affairs, religion, to arts and morality, the writings are called Sift Text or '乩文'.
“To me, she was a great human being and I can’t forget the way she loved me and my husband.
Different gods in the Daoist pantheon are designated for temples which have to go through the rigour of acceptance before the contents are recognized as authorized communiques from heaven.
She was very upset when my husband passed away since she regarded him as her son and also since he was the one who introduced her on television.
Huiyang District (postal: Waiyeung; is a district of Huizhou, Guangdong province, People's Republic of China.
After his death, she refused to work for TV for sometime since she felt that she couldn’t go near the TV station without Shahzad there.
It was renamed in 2003 amid the restructuring of districts and counties in Huizhou.
Behroze Sabzwari became quite emotional when asked about her and said she was a great lady and learned people like her should grace acting since the art needs them.
Formerly named Huiyang city (county level), its size shrank after the restructuring with several towns incorporated into the Huicheng district of Huizhou.
"I knew her for more than 30 years and I can't forget the love she gave to me.
Huiyang is the southern urban center of Huizhou along with Huicheng as the northern urban center.
She was jolly on the set, while brave and loving in real life.
There is a bus service from Huiyang District to Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport in Shenzhen.
She treated me more like a son than a colleague as I was very young when I started acting.
Qualifying for the 2010 FIBA World Championship in Turkey commenced as early as 2007 and will culminate in the five continental championships in each of the five FIBA zones.
All those who worked with her miss her but to me, she will always remain special."
The final ranking of each continental championship determines which teams go to Turkey for the world championship, with FIBA allocating slots partly based on a zone's strength.
Azra Sherwani was also associated with advertising and was part of renowned advertising agencies, churning out memorable commercials on TV and the print media as a member of the creative and client management departments.
In addition to the host, the gold medalists in the 2008 Olympic basketball championship are also allocated automatic berths to the championship.
Her viewers remember the pan-chewing, sari-clad and dominating Apa Begum who showed her anger by repeatedly saying: "Warna mujh se bura koi nahin hoga."
Teams that failed to crack the top positions in their respective continental championships may still be selected as wild cards to fill out the 24-team cast.
There was no one better than her when it came to character acting as she always portrayed her characters to perfection, making them memorable and lively.
A total of 106 countries participated in qualification to the world championship.
Sherwani was born in Meerut, India, according to family sources.
This is less than in the 2010 FIFA World Cup (204) and 2010 FIVB Men's World Championship (109), but more than the 2011 Rugby World Cup (98) and the 2011 Cricket World Cup (about 100).
She married Nafees Sherwani, Air Commodore in the Pakistan Air Force.
Turkey is automatic qualifier as the host country.
She died on December 19, 2005, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States.
The USA also received an automatic berth for winning the 2008 Olympic Men's Basketball Tournament.
Developed by DreamWorks Interactive and published by EA Games, the music was created by award-winning composer Michael Giacchino.
Eighteen other teams qualified through continental qualifying tournaments, and FIBA invited four more "wild card" teams to fill out the 24-team field.
Most of the tracks were reproduced on a new CD for the 10th anniversary edition box-set, with the exception of the last two tracks.
Each FIBA zone is allocated a certain amount of automatic berths based upon the strength of its zone: the weakest zone, Oceania, gets only two automatic berths each, while Europe gets six.
The discography of British electronic musician Chicane consists of six studio albums, two compilation album, one extended play and Thirtyseven singles.
Certain peculiarities include:
His debut single, "Offshore" reached number fourteen in the United Kingdom and number five on dance chart in the United States in 1996.
Qualifying tournaments:
The subsequent debut album, "Far from the Maddening Crowds", peaked at number forty-nine in the UK.
The draw for the championship will take place in Istanbul on December 15, 2009.
Chicane had his commercial breakthrough with the album "Behind the Sun", released on 27 March 2000.
La Guiannée (or La Guignolée) is celebrated on December 31 (New Year's Eve)
It sold over 100,000 copies and was certified gold in the UK, and spawned the hit singles "Saltwater" and "Don't Give Up".
It is a French medieval New Year's Eve tradition that is still practiced in two towns in the United States.
"Saltwater" sampled "Theme from Harry's Game" by Irish group Clannad and became a popular track in nightclubs across Europe; it reached number six in the UK and charted in countries such as Australia, Ireland and the Netherlands.
The tradition related to poor people being able to ask the more wealthy for food and drink at the celebrations of winter.
It became a number one hit in the UK and a top 20 hit in the United States, Australia, Finland and Belgium.
Customarily a troupe of traveling male singers went from door to door to entertain and ring in the new year.
On 23 July 2007 Chicane released his third studio album, "Somersault" on his own record label, Modena.
Hosts were expected to give them food and drink.
The lead single, released in 2006, "Stoned in Love" featured Welsh singer Tom Jones and reached number seven in the UK.
Other sources say the young men were seeking donations for Twelfth Night.
In 2009 Chicane released a cover version of "Hoppípolla" by Icelandic band Sigur Rós, titled "Poppiholla", which became his fourth top 10 hit in the UK.
Begun as a way for the poor to be given gratuities by the rich, it also became a community social event for young men to visit with the families of young women.
Chicane released his fourth studio album, "Giants" on 2 August 2010.
Over time, the practice became an occasion for visiting with relatives and friends and was more or less a traveling feast.
Less radio friendly singles includes "Right Here Right Now", "Footprint" and "Nagasaki Badger" under the Disco Citizens alias.
At first it was carried on only by young men, often in costume; women joined the party in the 20th century.
Released from 1995 to 1998 and initially a collaboration with producer Leo Elstob, all three charted within the top 60 in the UK.
In many years, the people appeared in disguise, as part of the celebration was a kind of overturning of the common order.
The Yagai-suigu ("field cooker") are movable cooking facilities equipped by the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force.
This tradition has been practiced annually since 1722 in Prairie du Rocher, Illinois.
The Yagai-suigu I  is a cooking vehicle introduced in 1962 (Shōwa 37).
It has been revived in Ste. Genevieve, Missouri.
It can serve rice for 600 people or misoshiru for 1500 people at once with its six kerosene-powered furnaces.
Both were former French colonial villages settled by French Canadians in the eighteenth century.
In 2004 Chūetsu earthquake, about 160 Yagai-suigu I were sent out from all around Japan to the Niigata Stadium to help afflicted people.
In the latter town, current celebrations feature singers and musicians, attired in colonial dress, who begin their night's journey at the local American Legion Hall.
The Yagai-suigu I Modified  is a modified version of the Yagai-Suigu I.
They make their way through all the restaurants, bars, nursing homes and high school gyms, ending at midnight at the Knights of Columbus Hall.
It equips automated igniter, electric generator, cold boxes, and faucets to supply water into the kettles.
Translation of the words of the traditional song, "La Guignolée":
Due to its electrical equipments, the Yagai-suigu I Modified has poor waterproofness and must be used indoors when it rains.
"Good evening master and mistress,"
The Yagai-suigu II  is a set of three kerosene-powered furnaces and fuel tanks and has the ability to serve 50 people.
"And all who live with you."
Yagai-suigu II Modified  includes wheeled furnaces with automated igniters, kettles, fuel tanks, water pumps, cold boxes, and a power generator.

Pershing Field is a city square and park in the Heights of Jersey City, New Jersey in the United States.
He began training in track and sumo wrestling as a child.
Approximately it is adjacent to Jersey City Reservoir No. 3, with which it creates a large open recreational and nature area bounded by Summit Avenue, Central Avenue, and Manhattan Avenue.
In 1954, he began to train in judo in high school and became the Northern Japan High School Champion in 1955.
The site had been intended for a reservoir, and extension of the system connected to Reservoir #3.
He entered Nihon University in 1956.
The park, originally planned in 1918 as Reservoir Park, opened for track and field events in 1919, including those of the Amateur Athletic Union, as well as other passive and recreational activities.
His children includes a son, Nicolas Yonezuka and a daughter, Natacha Yonezuka-Gullo.
It was designed by the noted landscape architect Charles N. Lowrie, responsible for Lincoln Park and the Stephen R. Gregg Park in Bayonne.
Yonezuka died at Hackensack University Medical Center Hackensack, New Jersey on October 18, 2014 of complications of Myelodysplastic syndrome, a rare form of blood cancer that resembles acute leukemia.
the park was named for General John J. Pershing, associating it with the previous use of the grounds as a World War I military training ground.
A bone marrow drive was attempted to no avail.
Although invited, General Pershing declined an invitation to attend the July 4 opening ceremony with a letter of apology.
After defeating nine 2nd degree blackbelts in succession at the Kodokan, he received a special promotion to 3rd degree black belt.
It continued to be used for track meets into the 1930s, hosting Stanisława Walasiewicz and Babe Didrikson Zaharias, among others.
He also began studying Shorinji Kempo and several styles of karate including wado ryu, and shito-ryu.
Over the years it has come serve as a memorial park for servicemen since World War I.
In 1959, he was a member of the university team winning the team championship.
At Summit Avenue there is a large arch made of reddish sandstone, the only remnant of the Fourth Regiment Armory building that once stood at the site of the Jersey City Armory.
The following year he graduated Nihon University majoring in business.
It was reconstructed in Pershing Field in 1941 and later named a Jersey City designated historic site.
Following his childhood dream he went to the United States and began teaching judo at West Point Military Academy.
A statue "America Triumphant" designed by James Novelli, commemorates the 147 Hudson County residents who lost their lives during WW1.
In 1960 he moved to the United States.
Other commemorative monuments to US military personnel are the Korean War memorial dedicated on Armistice Day, November 11, 1998, and the Jersey City Vietnam Veterans Memorial on Memorial Day, May 28, 2001.
In 1962, Yonezuka founded the Cranford Judo Karate Center.
Along the walking paths throughout the park are small stone markers with plaques bearing the names of veterans from World Wars I and II.
He was also the founding coach of the Judo program at New Jersey Institute of Technology (then known as "Newark College of Engineering") during the mid-60s.
The Heights Vietnam Veterans Memorial Community Center was dedicated in 1986.
Additionally, he served as an instructor at the Jerome Mackey judo schools.
At the Central Avenue side of there are number of recreational venues for track, baseball, and tennis as well as a swimming pool and a skating rink.
Yonezuka was twice chosen to serve as head coach of the United States at the Olympics Judo Team, and he coached three U.S. World Judo Championships Teams as well.
Khalid Hamdaoui is a Dutch footballer (with ancestral roots tracing back to Morocco) who played in 2013 for Woodlands Wellington in the S.League.
Yonezuka believed that the Japanese could not accept that Judo became more like wrestling and less of a martial art.
He signed in the beginning of 2014 with Al-Nasr SC (Salalah), from Oman.
He is also founder, former President and former Executive Director of the U.S. Sumo Federation.
Khalid is comfortable in playing any position across the midfield and is a former Dutch Under-21 international.
In 2007 he was awarded the rank of Kudan by the United States Judo Federation (USJF), which is the Ninth Degree black belt in Judo becoming one of only several American residents to be honored with the second highest Judo Degree.
Born and raised in Amsterdam, Khalid was discovered as a youth prodigy while playing for non-league side, SC Overamstel.
Since 1995 he also held the 8th Degree Black Belt in Judo from the Kodokan Judo Institute in Japan, an 8th Degree Black Belt in Karate, and was a Godan (Fifth Degree) in Sumo.
He was then drafted into the prestigious Ajax Amsterdam youth academy where he played alongside Roy Makaay and Rafael van der Vaart.
Additionally he appeared on the cover of the United States Judo Federation Magazine along with Allen Coage in 1977.
Upon leaving the academy, Khalid subsequently spent 2 seasons each for Eredivisie sides AZ Alkmaar and NAC Breda.
He would also serve as coach of Sumo Wrestler Emanuel Yarbrough.
In 2001, Hamdaoui made an important step to further his footballing career, travelling to Japan as an 18-year-old for trials.
The men's 200 metre freestyle event at the 2005 Maccabiah Games took place on 11 July at the Wingate Institute.
The president of J.League side Tokyo Verdy 1969 was impressed by his Ajax Amsterdam background and he was offered him a contract.
This swimming event used freestyle swimming, which means that the method of the stroke is not regulated (unlike backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly events).
Among Hamdaoui's colleagues in the Japanese team was the well-known Brazilian star Edmundo, who signed for Tokyo Verdy 1969 during the 2001 J. League Division 1 mid-season transfer window.
Nearly all swimmers use the front crawl or a variant of that stroke.
After spending a year in the Portuguese Primeira Liga with O Elvas C.A.D. and another three seasons back home in the Netherlands with MVV Maastricht and FC Omniworld, Hamdaoui made the switch to Scottish First Division side, Dundee FC during the 2006–07 Scottish First Division season.
Because an Olympic size swimming pool is 50 metres long, this race consisted of four lengths of the pool.
He made an impressive start for Dundee FC when he scored twice and created an assist for a teammate in a friendly match.
Prior to this competition, the existing Maccabiah record was as follows.
Hamdaoui's first goal in the Scottish First Division would come against Clyde FC on 17 February 2007.
The following new Maccabiah records were set during this competition.
In 2008, Hamdaoui decided to trace his ancestral roots and move to Morocco.
S. John Jacob (born 19 May 1953) is an Indian politician and was a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) in Tamil Nadu.
He subsequently signed a contract with Raja Casablanca on 5 August 2008, one of the most celebrated football clubs of North Africa, and won a Botola championship medal with the Green Eagles during the 2008–09 season.
Jacob was born on 19 May 1953 in Paduvoor and died on 13 Feb 2018.
On 14 January 2013, S.League club, Woodlands Wellington, announced that it had captured the signing of Hamdaoui after the Dutchman had impressed the management during his trial with the club.
He is married and has two children.
On 21 February 2013, Hamdaoui made his debut for the Rams in a home game against Warriors F.C. where he outshone Kazuyuki Toda by scoring one goal and assisting Moon Soon-Ho to another, helping the Rams draw the match with a 2 – 2 scoreline.
Jacob was elected to the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly as an Indian National Congress (INC) candidate from Killiyur constituency in Kanyakumari district in the 2006 election.
Khalid's six-month contract ended with the Rams in June 2013 and his contract was not extended.
He was one of 14 MLAs who had a 100 per cent attendance record in the 13th Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly.
He played 12 league matches for Woodlands Wellington and scored 4 goals.
Jacob was re-elected from Killiyur as an INC candidate in 2011 but switched his allegiance to the Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC) when G. K. Vasan revived it in 2014.
On 5 January 2014, Khalid Hamdaoui signed a 1-year contract with Al-Nasr SC (Salalah), from Qatar.
Assigned to the Killiyur constituency once again, his was one of 26 names put forward by the TMC to contest the 2016 state assembly elections as part of an alliance with the People's Welfare Front and Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam.
They were looking for that kind of player", said Robert Cristian Trif, Hamdaoui's agent.
However, one week later it was announced that D. Kumaradas would contest the seat for the TMC instead.
Loretta Jones is a fictional character from the British Channel 4 soap opera, "Hollyoaks", and its spin-off series, "Hollyoaks Later".
The constituency was won by the INC candidate, S. Rajesh Kumar.
The character is played by Melissa Walton and first appeared on-screen on 26 November 2008 during the first series of the "Hollyoaks" spin-off "Hollyoaks Later" as a new love interest for the character Dominic Reilly (John Pickard).
Bejsebakke or Sorthøj is a locality in Ansgar Parish, Fleskum Herred, Aalborg Municipality, Denmark where traces of prehistoric settlements from both the Stone Age, Bronze Age and Iron Age were found.
She made her first appearance in the "Hollyoaks" series in February 2009 and was the first character to be introduced to the series by producer Lucy Allan.
The area have been archaeologically excavated two times.
In 2010 Loretta was axed from the series, along with 15 other characters, during a cast cull by executive producer Paul Marquess.
In 1958 an excavation was conducted by the National Museum of Denmark and in the years 1999 and 2000 by the Aalborg Historical Museum.
The character development has Loretta having worked as a pole dancer and Walton put extensive research into the role, including visiting strip clubs.
This excavation was found among other traces more than 350 pit houses and 40-50 large houses from the Iron Age.
Despite this occupation Loretta has been portrayed out of conjunction with the blonde stereotype.
The area is also rich in relics of the Stone Age flint mines.
She has been involved in storylines which include facing prejudice, body scarring issues and stalking fellow characters.
Reed Amussen Benson (January 2,1928-August 24, 2016) was a retired Brigham Young University (BYU) professor of religion who at one time was the national director of public relations for the John Birch Society and is noted for his extreme political conservatism and his advocacy of homeschooling.
The character is most noted for the series intending to portray her as a child murderer trying to piece her life back together.
Benson is the son of Ezra Taft Benson and his wife, the former Flora Amussen.
The plot was subsequently axed having caused a great amount of controversy among the British public after newspapers alleged that the storyline was copying a real-life case.
Benson was born in Salt Lake City but raised in Whitney and Boise, Idaho and in Washington, D.C.
Loretta has been positively received by the media for her appearance and has been dubbed a "blond bombshell".
He began his studies as a student at BYU in 1945.
Before Loretta's departure from the series Marquess made changes to the characters persona: portraying her as a stalker being obsessive, calculating and pretending to have leukaemia.
From 1947 to 1949 he served as a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in Great Britain.
In her final storyline it was revealed that she had been sexually abused as a child and admitted herself to a psychiatric hospital.
Benson wrote his 1981 Ed.D. dissertation at BYU on the development of a home school.
The character of Loretta was created as a temporary love interest for Dominic Reilly (John Pickard) and was intended to feature only in "Hollyoaks Later", the spin-off from the "Hollyoaks" series.
This was one of the first doctoral dissertations written in the United States on the subject of homeschooling.
In 2009 it was announced that the "Hollyoaks"<nowiki>'</nowiki> producer Lucy Allan had decided to introduce both Loretta and Cheryl Brady (Bronagh Waugh) into the main show.
From 1975 to 1978, Benson served as president of the Louisville Kentucky Mission of the LDS Church.
Allan said, "Cheryl and Loretta will bring an energy and a sense of fun to the show.
He was also an LDS Chaplain during the Korean War.
Both Melissa and Bronagh impressed me with their performances in "Hollyoaks Later" and I'm sure viewers will warm to them quickly."
Benson lived in the Pleasant View neighborhood of Provo, Utah.
Loretta was initially paired with Dom and, after ending their relationship, was given links to other characters in the series.
In 2001 Benson and his wife, May Hinckley Benson, were honored with the Elijah Award for their contribution to the advancement of Homeschooling.
To prepare for the role Walton took pole-dancing classes and visited a lap dancing club.
Benson is the father of nine children, all of whom were home schooled.
After watching girls perform at the club she carried out routines in her underwear.
Paestum Airfield is an abandoned World War II military airfield in Italy, located approximately 9 km north-northeast of Agropoli, in the province of Salerno, in the Campania region of Italy.
She also had a pole set up in her living room to carry on practicing.
It was an all-weather temporary field built by the United States Army Air Force XII Engineer Command using a graded earth compacted surface, with a prefabricated hessian (burlap) surfacing known as PHS.
Speaking of her research Walton stated: "I loved it.
PHS was made of an asphalt-impregnated jute which was rolled out over the compacted surface over a square mesh track (SMT) grid of wire joined in 3-inch squares.
They didn't ask me to, but I did... I went and I had pole dancing classes.
Pierced Steel Planking was also used for parking areas, as well as for dispersal sites, when it was available.
Though Walton had initially signed on for a three-month stint Allan decided to renew her contract in 2009 and keep Loretta in the series until 2010.
In addition, tents were used for billeting and also for support facilities; an access road was built to the existing road infrastructure; a dump for supplies, ammunition, and gasoline drums, along with a drinkable water and minimal electrical grid for communications and station lighting.
In early 2010 it was announced that Allan had stepped down from the position of executive producer and that Paul Marquess had taken over the role.
Once completed it was turned over for use by the Twelfth Air Force 33d Fighter Group which operated P-40 Warhawks from the field between 13 September-18 November 1943, supporting ground forces as they advanced and attacking enemy aircraft on the air and ground.
It was soon revealed that Marquess planned to give Hollyoaks a "shake up", changing the productions team and beginning a cast cull by axing three established characters.
Later, the 340th Bombardment Group operated B-25 Mitchell medium bombers from the field between 23 March and 14 April 1944.
Stephanie Waring (who plays Cindy Hutchinson) then revealed that all remaining cast members feared their own character would be axed.
After the 340th moved out the airfield was dismantled.
One month later Marquess announced his plans to axe a further 11 characters, including Loretta at the end of Walton's contract.
Today, there are no remaining traces of the airfield as the area around the town of Paestum are heavily farmed and the agricultural use has obliterated any trace of the airfield.
It was also revealed that Loretta would depart at the same time as her current love interest Jake Dean (Kevin Sacre).
It is unknown precisely where the airfield was actually located due to the changed landscape over the past 60 years.
On 8 June 2010 Walton filmed her final scenes for the series, along with two fellow cast members Scare and Gerard McCarthy (who plays Kris Fisher).
Daniel Barber is a British director.
She spoke of her upset over leaving her fellow cast members, but later said she was looking forward to pursuing other projects.
Having begun his career as a highly successful director of commercials, he was nominated for an Academy Award in 2008 for his short film "The Tonto Woman".
Walton also confirmed that she was happy the door was left open for a potential return, stating that she would consider reprising her role as Loretta in the future.
In 2009 he directed Michael Caine in "Harry Brown".
Walton also said she understood why Marquess axed her character, he did not feel Loretta had anywhere left to go after the cancellation of her main storyline.
Barber was born in London.
However, she also felt like she deserved another chance to prove herself.
He studied graphic design at St Martins School of Art, where he graduated in 1988.
Loretta has stated on-screen that she does not want to conform with the stereotype of a blond pole dancer, and makes it clear that she is a keen bird watcher and enjoys documentaries.
He subsequently joined the TV department at Lambie-Naim & Co, where he designed and directed title sequences, including those for the BBC Nine O'Clock News.
Speaking of the character Walton stated, "I love that Loretta's not a stereotypical stripper sort of girl—there’s a lot more depth to her.
In 1991, he completed new identities for BBC1 and BBC2, for which he won a BAFTA and a D&AD award.
She’s got lots of interesting little hobbies, like bird-watching and Roman history!
In 1993, he joined Rose Hackney Productions where he directed commercials full-time.
Then at night she skips off and turns into a stripper.
His work was showcased at the Cannes International Advertising Festival and in 1994, he was named as a Creative Face of the Future by Campaign magazine and as one of the UK's "Hotshot" commercial directors.
It’s like two different lives, and I think many real-life pole-dancers are like that.
By 1995, he became a partner and Rose Hackney became Rose Hackney Barber.
They’re really nice, normal girls by day, and by night they turn into these temptresses."
He has won dozens of awards for his commercials both in Europe and The United States of America.
Walton also praised the soap's realistic portrayal of the occupation, saying that many pole dancers attend university or have good professions but rely on stripping for extra money, and that she has met people like her character in the strip club where "Hollyoaks" films scenes.
In 2003, his work was also included in the top ten of Channel 4's "100 Greatest Commercials".
Walton hopes viewers will find Loretta's alter ego as a stripper tasteful commenting, "As tasteful as you can be in a pink frilly bra and knicker set, with a little skirt that’s more like a belt, and back-combed hair and fake eyelashes!"
In 2006, Barber became a partner at London-based film production company Knucklehead, where he continues to direct commercials.
Loretta's relationships helped develop the character.
His most recent work includes commercials for Adidas, Audi, The BBC, Estee Lauder, Sony, BMW, Orange, O2, Hewlett Packard, SAP, DHL and the Royal Air Force.
Her first relationship is with Dom Reilly who shares her interests in bird watching, documentaries on ancient Rome and literature.
Barber's first film was "The Tonto Woman", a 35-minute western based on a short story by Elmore Leonard.
The relationship immediately gave viewers an insight into the character.
The film is about a cattle rustler who becomes involved in the life of a woman who has been held captive by Mojave Indians for the past 11 years and is now living in isolation.
However, as their relationship progressed, it became apparent that Dom could not handle Loretta's profession as he feared for her safety, which ultimately lead to their break up.
The film won Best Film at Palm Springs 2007, Best of Festival at LA Shorts 2008 and was nominated for an Oscar in 2008.
Loretta's second relationship is a short-lived fling with Ravi Roy (Stephen Uppal) where she is determined to see the good in him, and help him while he suffers from a brain aneurysm, but ends the relationship when he attempts to assault her.
Following "The Tonto Woman", Barber directed his first full-length feature, "Harry Brown" starring Michael Caine, who plays a widowed ex-marine whose retirement is disrupted when a gang of vicious thugs take over his neighbourhood and murder his best friend.
Loretta then begins a secret romance with Jake, who had tried to murder his child and rape his wife.
Described as a modern urban western, it reflects the stark realities of youth crime in the 21st century.
Loretta believes he had been misled and is still a good person, demonstrating Loretta's willingness to give people second chances.
It had its World Premiere as a Special Presentation at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival and was received with standing ovations.
Walton comments, "[Loretta] is just lovely – she sees the good in everyone."
The film was released theatrically on 11 November 2009 at the Odeon Leicester Square.
When television listings magazine "What's on TV" challenged Walton to explain why Loretta would be interested in Jake after his crimes Walton said, "Loretta's big on forgiveness.
Baron Jakob von Washington (January 26, 1778 – April 5, 1848) K.C.O.B. was a Lieutenant General in the Bavarian Army and a distant relative of US President George Washington.
She believes Jake’s changed, that he's learnt from his time inside and he's paid his debt to society."
Born in The Hague, Netherlands, he was christened James Washington, but officially named Jacobus Washington.
After Marquess decided to axe Loretta he changed the character's direction and her persona.
Most of his adult life was shaped by his participation in wars for and against Napoleonic France and his service to Ludwig I of Bavaria.
She became obsessive over men, controlling towards Jake, manipulative and began lying to get what she wanted.
The known history of the Washington family goes back to the 12th century.
Jake later decides he does not want her, of this Walton states that: "She's not going anywhere.
Sir Robert Washington (d. 1324) was the progenitor of the branch of the family residing in Sulgrave Manor, England.
She also is shown have "bunny boiler" tendencies, with Walton agreeing to the label.
One of his descendants, John Washington, emigrated to Virginia in 1656 and was the great-grandfather of George Washington.
Walton later revealed that Loretta began pole dancing to have power over men because of the abuse she suffered as a child although, as Loretta's exit approached, she was now a dangerous and deluded woman.
The brother of Sir Robert, Sir John Washington (d. 1331), founded the Hallhead Hall/Adwick-le-street branch of the Washingtons.
In November 2009 Loretta became the centre of media controversy when various media outlets announced that Loretta would be part of a storyline which revealed that she had murdered a child in her past.
His descendant, James Washington, accompanied John Washington to Virginia, but returned to England, then shortly thereafter emigrated to Rotterdam, the Netherlands.
The controversy began when tabloid newspaper "The Sun" compared the storyline to the real life murder of James Bulger.
There he married a Dutchwoman named Clara van der Lauen, leading, five generations later, to Jacobus Washington.
Bulger had been murdered when he was two years old by two young children.
On February 2, 1777, Daniel Washington, aged 46 and a military solicitor, married Elisabeth Cornelia Hoogstad.
Being just 10 years of age they were handed small sentences to serve and were later released with new identities.
Jacobus was born on January 26, 1778.
Soon afterwards various other news sources and lifestyle magazines picked up the story and mimicked "The Sun" and its claims.
His only sibling, Daniel, was born July 27, 1781.
Bulger's mother, Denise Fergus, condemned the storyline.
Their father died in October 1786, and their mother in September 1789, leaving them orphaned at 11 and 8 years old.
While speaking to the news website Click Liverpool she criticised the decision to air a plot that allegedly mirrored her son's death, stating they should have consulted her first.
Little is known of their lives for some years after.
She said, "I'm shocked and disgusted at what "Hollyoaks" is doing.
Daniel remained in the Netherlands, married in 1808, and died in 1813, apparently without children.
They have clearly based this story on what happened to James and it's outrageous that they should do this without consulting with me in any way."
In 1794, aged 16, Jacobus Washington joined the Dutch Army.
She threatened to encourage a boycott of the show.
When the French invaded later that year he fought against them.
Channel 4 released a statement defending the plot, explaining it had nothing to do with any real life case: "The forthcoming storyline is not based on any real-life case and it will in no way seek to recreate real events.
His lot under French domination in the new Batavian Republic was not a happy one.
The storyline focuses on the psychological repercussions for two characters in the show who were responsible for the death of a 12-year-old girl in the past."
In 1799, in a letter to George Washington, Jacobus offered his services to the United States in its undeclared Quasi-War with France, but was turned down due to his inexperience.
The storyline would answer questions for viewers who had been speculating on Loretta's secret past.
He then moved to the Kingdom of Bavaria, where he joined the Bavarian Army.
It would reveal that Loretta had spent time in prison for her crime, was born with the name Joanna Norman, and is living under a false identity.
He came to the attention of Crown Prince Ludwig, who made Jakob his adjutant.
Speaking about delving into her character's history Walton commented to entertainment website Digital Spy, "It took a little while and until now, we've known little about her.
In July 1807 Jakob was present at the negotiations for the Treaties of Tilsit following the victory of the French Empire (of which Bavaria was now an ally) over Russia.
Nobody in the village knows who she is or where she's come from.
Over the next few years he advanced to the rank of Colonel.
She's just planted herself in the village knowing hardly anybody.
In October 1813, Bavaria joined the Allies against France.
I'm absolutely loving the opportunity to explore her backstory."
On June 7, 1815 in Brussels, Jakob Washington signed a treaty with the Duke of Wellington representing Bavaria.
Speaking about her reaction to the plot she continued, "I was like, 'Oh my gosh!'
On the night of June 15, 1815, prior to the Battle of Quatre Bras, Jakob was an invited guest at the now famous Duchess of Richmond's ball.
I was so shocked but absolutely chuffed to bits because this is what all actors want – something massive like this to sink my teeth into.
He fought in the Battle of Waterloo, the only Bavarian officer to do so, since the rest of the Bavarians were held in reserve in Saarbrücken.
I feel so privileged that they've trusted me with this story.
In 1825, Ludwig became King of Bavaria as Ludwig I. Washington's career continued apace, rising eventually to Lieutenant General.
I know they've wanted to do it for a while and they've finally chosen me!"
On December 8, 1829 Ludwig made him Freiherr (Baron) von Washington.
In the same interview Walton described the storyline, "Loretta and Chrissy were best, best friends through childhood.
Ludwig also appointed him Grand Chamberlain and Marshal of his military household.
She somehow tracks Loretta down and turns up out of the blue after Loretta's finished a dance class.
In 1843, on a visit to London, Queen Victoria dubbed him a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath.
What we learn is that when they were 12, they bullied a young girl and didn't stop until they killed her.
Jakob's first wife was baroness Antonie van Löchner (born Baroness von Verger) (1788–1830), a wealthy widow.
Since then, Loretta and Chrissy have been completely separated from each other, their families and friends.
They had two sons, Ludwig August (1827–1845) and Maximilian Emanuel von Washington (1829–1903).
They've spent years in institutions having psychiatric and behavioural treatment."
After her death, he married baroness Caroline Segesser von Brunegg (1802–1841) in 1833.
Kevin Sacre, whose character was directly involved in the storyline, voiced his support for the plot stating: "I think the fact that it's the sort of thing that happens in real life means it's something that should be addressed.
Through this marriage he gained the Castle Notzing, near the town of Erding, Bavaria.
Anyone who buries their head in the sand is a bit naïve.
They had a son, Carl Theodor von Washington (1833–1897).
And I think soap is a medium where you can explore issues of real life."
Baron Jakob von Washington died in Notzing on April 5, 1848.
Just days before the episodes were set to transmit Channel 4 announced that it was axing the storyline, due in part to Fergus's reaction to the storyline.
Maximilian Emanuel also became Grand Chamberlain, married Duchess Frederica of Oldenburg (sister of Queen Amalia of Greece), and had two sons, one of whom, named George, served in the 11th Hussars of the Austro-Hungarian army reaching the rank of captain.
Whilst Walton had previously claimed the storyline was about three twelve-year-old girls, Channel 4 admitted the similarities between the story and the Bulger case.
However, despite reports to the contrary, he did not fight during the First World War, having retired before the War started.
"This particular storyline was not based on any real life case and was not intended to recreate actual events.
Both sons died without issue, and since none of Jakob's other children had any offspring, the von Washington line became extinct.
However, after conversations with Denise Fergus we have agreed to amend certain aspects of the storyline."
Leonard Francis McAllister Jr. (born January 13, 1972) is a libertarian American political commentator for a number of newspapers and websites, including AOL and The Root.
Amber Hodgkiss, who was cast to play Chrissy, expressed her disappointment over the decision to axe the plot all together saying, "The storyline has been completely cut.
McAllister was born Leonard Francis McAllister, Jr. on January 13, 1972 in Pittsburgh to parents Leonard, Sr. and Carol McAllister.
I would like it to go ahead, but I don't have that decision.
Both he and his mother almost died during childbirth.
It wasn't based on Jamie Bulger, but people portrayed it that way.
McAllister grew up in the Penn Hills, a suburb outside Pittsburgh.
It was quite a big storyline that could affect people, but it happens."
His father was a computer technician and an electrician for a local steel mill, and his mother ran a daycare out of the family home before her death in 2006.
Fergus said she was grateful that the plot was axed saying, "I'm grateful that they are respecting my wishes.
McAllister attended middle school at St. Bart's School, playing football and basketball.
I made it clear that I did not want those scenes broadcast and I'm pleased to say they clearly understood my feelings."
Always undersized, McAllister quarterbacked the school's 14-and-under football team to a championship as an 11-year-old.
When episodes that were intended to feature the storyline transmitted, they instead featured a selection of then "last minute" scenes.
He then attended Central Catholic High School for a few years before leaving to take a scholarship to Shady Side Academy.
In these scenes Hodgkiss portrays a new character, Caroline, who holds Loretta and Jake hostage.
He graduated from Shady Side in 1989, earning scholarship offers to several universities.
Marquess began writing scripts to facilitate Loretta's departure as Walton's filming was to finish in June 2010, with a departure date of August that same year.
In 1989, McAllister enrolled at Davidson College, on "the 13-year path to a four-year degree".
Her exit from the series was described as dramatic, with Walton commenting on this during an interview with magazine programme "Live from Studio Five" stating, "I'm very pleased with my exit, you know.
He was slated to walk-on the Davidson basketball team as a freshman but declined after coach Bobby Hussey left Davidson after the 1988–1989 school year.
I've probably enjoyed the last few months of filming more than I've enjoyed anything else that I've done, to be honest."
He was a pitcher on the baseball team.
Loretta's backstory gradually began to unfold on-screen.
He left school in 1992 for a sabbatical that lasted a decade.
Loretta decided she needed to win Jake back.
Before leaving that spring, he contributed a piece on Black History Month to the school paper "The Davidsonian", receiving numerous anonymous threats, including isolated death threats.
Her ex-boyfriend Adam (Vlach Ashton) warned Jake that Loretta had previously stalked him.
McAllister dropped out of college for a decade and became a father at age 21 with the first of his two children.
This starts to damage their relationship and during an interview with "What's on TV" Walton commented on it saying that Jake was suspicious of Loretta's motives.
In 2000, McAllister re-enrolled at Davidson College, graduating with a history degree in 2002.
Loretta love for Jake turned into an obsession with Walton saying, "She's definitely not giving up on him.
In 2005, McAllister ran for office in Davidson, North Carolina, losing as the only Republican against an all-Democrat slate by only 56 votes.
What he thought was love is already actually an obsession.
In 2007, he ran and lost another close race, after McAllister was slated to win one of five seats in non-official polling.
The story line reveals her past of obsessions with men and Walton stated, "You sense Adam wasn't the only ex-partner she stalked.
In July 2008, he was featured in a series of commercials on Black Entertainment Television regarding the upcoming election.
Walton explains the cause of her behaviour, "You find out much later on that it's because of something that happened in her past.
Soon after, Fox Charlotte cast him as their political contributor during the 2008 campaign.
Her obsession really is getting full-on [...] She's jealous of anybody who gets Jake's attention."
McAllister provided live commentary during question-and-answer sessions and live editorials weekly on the "Fox News Rising" morning show, the Charlotte morning show.
After Jake's sister Steph Cunningham (Carley Stenson) is diagnosed with cervical cancer Loretta pretends she once had leukaemia in order to trap Jake.
McAllister attended the 2008 Republican National Convention representing Hip Hop Republicans, and provided commentary on CNN, Fox Charlotte, XM Radio, and BET, as well as webcasts on Washington Post and Fox.
He throws her out though because his son had previously suffered from the illness.
On CNN American Morning, he gave a critical view of the approach to the Governor Sarah Palin VP introduction to America, saying that her daughter’s pregnancy was an opportunity to make a connection to everyday Americans instead of trying to portray the Palins as perfect.
Loretta refuses to give up and her behaviour becomes more erratic.
In March 2013, he ran as a candidate in the Republican primary for Illinois's 2nd congressional district special election, but lost.
In the final episodes of her departure Loretta manages to convince everyone that Jake was mentally ill once more.
McAllister writes for several online magazines and blogs.
She takes Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox) hostage for snooping into her life with Adam and Walton states, "Loretta is dangerous and deluded, Nancy's terrified of her – she tries to escape but Loretta won't let her She accidentally pushes Nancy, who crashes into a table and bangs her head badly".
He has also been published in the "Charlotte Post", "Newsweek", and "The Dallas Morning News".
Walton also revealed more of Loretta's past saying, "Adam confesses that Loretta was violent towards him, basically she did some awful things to him that she's doing to Jake now."
He usually represents the Republican point of view in his writings, but from an Afro-centric perspective and has spoken out against racism in politics and society.
The storyline sought to explain all the unanswered questions left in her backstory with Walton saying, "He [Jake] tries to talk her round, and at that point she reveals she was sexually abused when she was very young.
He was a featured speaker at several Tea Party protests across the nation throughout 2009.
It's supposedly the reason she went into stripping to have power over men."
In physical rehabilitation and sports training, the SAID principle asserts that the human body adapts specifically to imposed demands.
Walton also defended Loretta's final actions, saying the character was confused and did not mean to hurt anyone.
In other words, given stressors on the human system, whether biomechanical or neurological, there will be a "Specific Adaptation to Imposed Demands" (SAID).
In Loretta's final scene she voluntarily admits herself into a psychiatric hospital after being convinced to by Jake.
For example, by only doing pull-ups on the same regular pull-up bar, your body becomes adapted to this specific physical demand, but not necessarily adapted to other climbing patterns or environments.
Loretta first appears as a stripper who works in a lap-dancing club.
In 1958, Berkeley Professor of Physical Education Franklin M. Henry proposed the "Specificity Hypothesis of Motor Learning".
During her job Loretta meets Dom.
Rivula stepheni is a species of moth of the Noctuidae family.
The pair like each other but she decides not to go out with him, she feels he is not yet over the death of his wife Tina (Leah Hackett).
It is found in eastern North Carolina, Louisiana and Florida.

The wingspan is about 17 mm.
Loretta clashes with Mercedes Fisher (Jennifer Metcalfe) who is not happy to find out that Dom has moved on from Tina.
Adults have been found from April to September in North Carolina, suggesting the species breeds continuously and likely has three or four generations per year.
Loretta moves in with Cindy Cunningham (Stephanie Waring) and Darren Osborne (Ashley Taylor Dawson).
The larvae feed on various grasses and sedges.
Loretta lies to Dom saying she has quit her job and does not tell him the truth until Darren finds out and begins to blackmail her.

Loretta then quits her job for Dom, but later finds a new job as a stripper at a different club.
It is native to much of the western United States, where it grows in moist mountain habitat, such as meadows.
Dom worries about Loretta's safety at her job and gives her a rape alarm, much to her amusement.
This is a small perennial herb growing from a taproot and caudex unit.
Loretta reassures him, but realises how serious it is for him when he reveals that Tina's abduction and death has left him uptight about safety.
It produces a basal rosette of several narrow, fingerlike to threadlike fleshy leaves up to 13 centimeters long.
They then end their relationship.
The inflorescence is a bundle of short stems a few centimeters tall each bearing a flower.
Loretta drunkenly teaches Nancy Hayton, Zoe Carpenter (Zoë Lister), Hannah Ashworth (Emma Rigby) and Sarah Barnes (Loui Batley) how to dance in the Student Union bar.
The flower has 5 to 10 shiny white to pale pink petals each 1 to 2 centimeters long, pointed or with blunt tips.
She slips and falls onto some glass bottles which break and cut her stomach.
At the center are many stamens.
Loretta is horrified when she is left scarred by the glass.
This is sometimes grown as an ornamental plant suitable for alpine and rock gardens.
Her boss sacks her, because her scars have rendered her unattractive, and Loretta is given a job in Tan & Tumble by Ash Roy (Junade Khan).
A Catskill Eagle is the 12th Spenser novel by Robert B. Parker, first published in 1985.
Loretta develops a crush on Ravi Roy which makes his brother Ash jealous.
The title comes from a quote from Herman Melville.

When Jake's sister Steph Cunningham (Carley Stenson) suggests the pair are moving too quickly Loretta agrees, she talks to Jake who gets angry showing his temper to Loretta for the first time.
The book climaxes with a deadly encounter deep in an underground shelter between Spenser and the Costigans.
Loretta strikes up a friendship with Holly Hutchinson (Lydia Waters) who aspires to be a dancer like Loretta after feeling unnoticed by her mother Cindy.
Several characters from previous books make an appearance in A Catskill Eagle.
As they bond Loretta gives Holly advice on dancing.
Chapman Intermediate School was formerly the only intermediate school in the Cherokee County School District in Woodstock, Georgia, United States.
Loretta faces prejudice when she starts applying for new jobs, as no one will employ her due to her previous jobs as a stripper.
The school served fifth and sixth graders.
She later lies during an interview, her interviewers discover her previous employment and make derogatory remarks to her.
In the spring of 2013, Chapman Intermediate School was closed, as it was no longer needed.
Holly runs away from home and a large-scale police investigation is put in place to find her.
Students who would have attended it now attend one of the four feeder elementary schools until fifth grade, and then attend E.T. Booth Middle School in sixth grade.
Many other residents in the village suspect Loretta's boyfriend Jake of being her kidnapper, unaware that she is safe and hiding in Darren's flat.
Chapman opened in 2000 with approximately 1150 fifth and sixth grade students and a staff of almost 100.
Loretta leaves Jake after she begins to doubt his innocence but later reconciles with him.
Until 1935, there was a small school located across from Bascomb Church on what is now Bascomb-Carmel Road.
After Jake finds Holly he chases her, she falls over and takes a blow to the head and falls into a coma.
It consisted of grades one through seven.
Initially the police suspect that Jake was behind this but later release him.
For the first few years of his teaching career, Clarence Chapman was the principal as well as one of the teachers.
Loretta once more begins to doubt him.
In 1935, Bascomb School was consolidated with another elementary school and was later torn down.
Upset, Jake goes to stay with his old friend Caroline (Amber Hodgkiss).
South Cherokee County remained a rural area into the mid-1960s.
After sleeping with him Caroline drugs him, ties him up, tries to kill him, and holds him hostage for a few days.
Highway 92 was paved in 1962.
She is angered to learn he is going out with Loretta and sets out to try to kill Holly but Loretta is there by Holly's bedside.
Until that time it had been an all-weather graveled road and was known as the Old Alabama Road.
Caroline tries to attack Loretta with a syringe needle but Jake saves Loretta and, in the process, Caroline is stabbed with the needle.
By 1966, Oak Grove School still had only one teacher per grade, from fourth through eighth grade.
After the ordeal Loretta disappears, having to accept the fact that Jake had cheated on her much to his dismay.
The total enrollment was 350 students.
She returns but while she was away Loretta had become involved with a realtor called Adam.
Woodstock School had an enrollment of around 600 students.
At first Jake thought she was looking for a home.
Around this time, south Cherokee County began growing by leaps and bounds.
However, when he saw them both arguing, Jake realises something was not as it seemed.
People began moving to the area and driving to work in Atlanta.
When Jake confronts Loretta she tells him that Adam was harassing her.
Woodstock Elementary and Oak Grove Elementary were both too small for the incoming students.
This leads to Jake confronting Adam and warning him to stay away from Loretta.
Rooms and buildings were added, only to be outgrown before they were completed.
However Adam tells him that Loretta had been controlling his life and that she wants to be with him.
A new school was the only answer.
Adam explains that Loretta had told him about Jake and that he was the biggest mistake of her life in the hope that Adam would take her back.
The property of the Chapman family was purchased for the new school.
Later she goes on a night out to The Loft nightclub and threatens Charlotte Lau (Amy Yamazaki).
Construction was begun in 1971 and completed in February 1974.
She says that she will kill Lau if she ever goes near Jake again, making viewers realise that Loretta had changed her personality and her behaviour since her absence.
From August 1973 until February 1974, the Chapman faculty and students were split and located at Woodstock and Oak Grove.
Loretta pretends she had Leukaemia but Jake finds out the truth and ends their relationship.
The school opened with grades one through eight.

The first principal was Young Smith.
She send messages from Jake's mobile phone and plants defaced pictures of her and Jake in his coat to make it look real.
During the 1970s and 1980s, the area continued to grow and E.T. Booth Middle School was built and opened nearby.
Loretta reveals to Steph that she was sexually abused as a child.
The seventh and eighth grade students from Chapman and other south Cherokee elementary schools were transferred to the new middle school.
Jake gets back together with Loretta to stop her from getting him put back into a mental health clinic.
A large two-story classroom building was added to the Chapman campus in 1990 to accommodate its ever-increasing enrollment.
Nancy finds out the truth about Loretta from Adam, she confronts Loretta who pushes her over and Nancy is badly hurt.
During the 1998-1999 school year, once again some decisions were needed to make arrangements for the growing schools in the area.
Jake saves Nancy and she agrees not to go to the police.
With parent and faculty input, the decision was made to create a school for fifth and sixth grade students and to house this new school at the Chapman campus.
Loretta reveals she did not lie when she was sexually abused and Jake asks her to get help and will stand by her.
Preparations were made to transition these students from Bascomb, Boston, and Oak Grove Elementaries.
Loretta is last seen admitting herself into the hospital.
In August 2000, Chapman Intermediate School opened with approximately 1150 fifth and sixth grade students and a staff of almost 100.
Loretta has been well received for her good looks and "sexy" image.
In 2011, the building of the new E.T. Booth Middle School began.
According to British tabloid "The Daily Star" the character was extremely popular with viewers on "Hollyoaks Later" and "went down a storm" with them.
This took sixth grade, and the elementary schools took fifth grade.
They also add that she rivals other characters such as Carmel Valentine (Gemma Merna) and Mercedes Fisher (Jennifer Metcalfe) with her "hot babe" image.
It is speculated that Chapman will become a ninth grade academy for Etowah High School.
Loretta has been noted in the media because of her "sexy blonde" image.
In January 2014, Chapman became Etowah East High School and featured some technology-based classes, such as AP Computer Science.
When she was axed from the series a magazine dedicated to "sexually attractive females" titled "Babemag" commented that the series would not be the same without her and praised Walton's portrayal, stating, "Sundays may never be quite the same as news filters through that Hollyoaks star, Melissa Walton, is to get the chop from the teen soap.
In the 2014-2015 school year, Chapman's cafeteria opened to students traveling between Etowah High School and Etowah East.
Horny Hollyoaks hangover TV might not be the same for us without the charms of Melissa Walton who plays Loretta Jones in the series."
The other building at Etowah East became home to the world language department in August 2014.
She has also been dubbed a "blonde bombshell" by media sources such as "Digital Spy" and the "South Wales Evening Post".
As a result, all trailers at Etowah High were scheduled to be removed from campus at the end of the 2013-2014 school year.
Five's soap opera reporting website "Holy Soap" describe Loretta's finest moment as her food fight with Mercedes when they clashed over Dom.

Ewbanks is located along a railroad line northeast of Quincy.
The Canada–Panama Free Trade Agreement is a free trade agreement between Canada and Panama that went into effect April 1, 2013.
It was previously known as "Eubanks".
The agreement was concluded on August 11, 2009 by Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli and signed by the two countries' trade ministers on May 14, 2010.
A post office called Eubanks was established in 1872, and remained in operation until 1895.
The agreement was approved by both countries' parliaments by December 2012, allowing the agreement to come into effect.
Winifred Carter (c. 1883–1949) was an English author and playwright, who was particularly active from the 1920s–40s ("not to be confused with Winifred S Carter, an American celebrity chef and cookery author also active from the 1920s–40s").
The agreement eliminates Panamanian tariffs on 90% of goods from Canada.
She was also the mother of the mystery and detective novel author Emery Bonett and the wife of novelist John L. Carter and actress and playwright Edith Carter.
The remaining 10% will be phased out within the next 10 years.
Winifred Carter's most successful work was probably her 1945 novel "Princess Fitz", which was made into a 1947 film of the same name.
Canada will remove 99% of its tariffs on goods from Panama.
It is a romance set in 1783, which chronicles the convoluted, yet ultimately doomed, relationship between a prince regent and a Catholic widow.

Asterleigh, sometimes in the past called Esterley, is a farm and deserted medieval village about northeast of Charlbury in Oxfordshire.
In 2008, bilateral merchandise trade between Canada and Panama totaled $149.1 million.
The site of the former village is about west of the present farm.
Trade has increased by 48 percent from 2007.
Asterleigh's toponym indicates that it was created by woodland clearance on what would then have been the edge of Wychwood Forest.
Canada made up $127.9 million of total trade between the two countries, while Panama made up the remaining $21.2 million.
The Domesday Book of 1086 does not record Asterleigh as a separate settlement.
Both countries parliament needed to approve the agreement before it could come into force.
Medieval pottery found in 1948 suggests that Asterleigh was inhabited by the 12th century.
The Canadian opposition parties had considered stalling the agreement over the issue of Panama being considered a tax haven.
Also in 1948, squared stones were found along with limestone roofing slates that had medieval-style drilled nail-holes.
The agreement was negotiated over four meetings.
The earliest known documentary record of Asterleigh is from early in the 13th century.
The first negotiation started in October 2008.
At the time of the Hundred Rolls in 1279 it had 20 farms.
The negotiations followed two exploratory meeting over a possible agreement.
However, the village declined and its landowning family decided to leave the village and move to Nether Kiddington.
In 1998, Panama and Canada signed the Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement (FIPA).
By the 18th century Asterleigh was no more than a farmhouse.
This agreement placed rights and obligations on foreign direct investments between the two countries.
Asterleigh Farm was an extra-parochial area of until 1858 when it was made a civil parish.
On May 14, 2010, Canada's International Trade Minister Peter Van Loan, along with Panama's Minister of Commerce and Industry, Roberto Henríquez, signed the Canada–Panama Free Trade Agreement (FTA), as well as parallel agreements on labour cooperation and the environment.
In 1895 it was combined with the civil parish of Kiddington.
On June 11, 2012 a bill to implement the trade, environmental, and labour agreements was introduced in the Canadian parliament as Bill C-24.
The site of the medieval village and church is now a Scheduled Ancient Monument.
The organisation was founded in 1874 as the Democratic and Trades Alliance Association.
Azra Sherwani (1940–2005) was a Pakistani television actress with a career spanning over 35 years who played a variety of roles.
Most of its initial members were tailors or shoemakers based in Soho, many had been active Chartists and, later, supporters of James Bronterre O'Brien, and almost all were active in the First International.
Amongst her most memorable roles are Apa Begum in "Tanhaiyaan", Ghazi Apa in "Uncle Urfi" and Fazeelat in "Dhoop Kinarey".
They included Maltman Barry, Johann Eccarius, Robert Gammage, John Bedford Leno, Charles Murray, James Murray, John Rogers, William Townshend and Henry Travis.
She began her career with the Rawalpindi Studios of PTV in the late 1960s.
In 1875, the club renamed itself as the "Manhood Suffrage League", taking its name from the northern section of the Reform League.
Sherwani worked with some of the best producers in the country including Mohsin Ali, late Shereen Khan, late Shahzad Khalil, Sultana Siddiqui, Zaheer Khan and Sahira Kazmi.
Around this time, Frank Kitz came into contact with the group.
She also worked with some of the best writers of her time including Fatima Surraiya Bajiya, Haseena Moin and Anwar Maqsood.
In 1877, Maltman Barry, by then the club's secretary, became an outspoken supporter of the Tory campaign to intervene in the Russo-Turkish War.
The role of Apa Begum in Haseena Moin's "Tanhaiyaan" was undoubtedly the most famous of her career where Shahzad Khalil cast her as a tough taskmaster who ill-treated her employee, Buqrat, played by Jamshed Ansari.
Much of the group objected to this, and the organisation ceased to function by the end of the year.
She logically argued (and winning in the end, of course) with him as to why he should get bus fare when walking can improve his health and solve the problem.
However, it subsequently revived, and by the early 1880s, it had become more interested in socialism.
Her character wanted her brother (Qazi Wajid as Faran) to marry a dominant woman which, fortunately, does not happen.
It is administratively part of the city of Vladivostok in Primorsky Krai, Russia, and is located south of the city center.
As Ghazi Apa in "Uncle Urfi", she stood between the two love birds, quarrelled regularly with Hasnat Bhai (Jamshed Ansari again) and was the dominant force behind the extremely funny Shaheer Bhai (Qurban Jilani).
Reyneke Island has an area of approximately and a population of 23 (2005), making it the smallest of four inhabited islands of Primorsky Krai both by area and population.
Azra played the selfish mother of Sitara (Atiqa Odho) in "Sitara Aur Mehr-un-nisa" and the despised mother-in-law aka Saliha Begum of Mahboob Ahmed (Shakeel) in "Aangan Terha" with Bushra Ansari and Saleem Nasir as Akbar, the live-in Man Friday with a passion for classical dance.
Most residents live in the island's single settlement of the same named located on the northern coast.
Then she was the villainous Mai Jaina in "Mera Naam Mangu" in the early 1970s — a play about professional beggars — while she excelled in Haseena Moin's "Parchaiyaan" as part of a star cast comprising Rahat Kazmi, Sahira Kazmi, Shakeel and Talat Hussain.
Pinales of the Korean pine variety are found on the island.
She held her own in Bajiya's "Afshaan", with fellow cast members Shafi Mohammad, Shakeel, Qazi Wajid, Ishrat Hashmi and Begum Khurshid Mirza.
The islet of Vykent Island and many kekurs are found around the coast.
In short, her histrionic talent set the standards for character acting on Pakistan television.
Reyneke Island is connected to mainland Vladivostok by a ferry, operating three times a week in the warm seasons.
Azra Sherwani worked with actors of all generations — from Qazi Wajid, Subhani Ba Yunus, Imtiaz Ahmed, Begum Khurshid Mirza, Qurban Jilani, Shakeel, Shafi Mohammad, Talat Iqbal, Anwar Maqsood, Akbar Subhan, Behroze Sabzwari, Shahnaz Sheikh, Marina Khan, Ishrat Hashmi, Jamshed Ansari, Babar Ali, Mazhar Ali, Mishi Khan, Atiqa Odho, Sania Saeed, Sajid Hasan and Sadia Imam.
Reyneke Island was named after Mikhail Reyneke, Vice Admiral of the Imperial Russian Navy and an early hydrographer of the Russian Hydrographic Service in the region.
When the advent of private productions brought about the decline of quality plays on PTV, Azra Sherwani sustained for some time, working in plays such as "Kanwal", Bajiya's "Ghar Ik Nagar" and Sultana Siddiqui's "Doosri Duniya".
INSAT-1B was an Indian communications satellite which formed part of the Indian National Satellite System.
Her most memorable role during the later part of her career was that of Khala Khairan in Riffat Humayun's serial of the same name.
Launched in 1983, it was operated in geostationary orbit at a longitude of 74 degrees east.
Her character was such that she quarrels with Qazi Wajid, a tenant in the house of Khala's folks who refuses to either leave or pay the rent.
At the end of its seven-year design life it was replaced by the newly launched INSAT-1D, dropping to backup status.
Qazi Wajid, who worked with her the most from 1970s to 2000, said she was a sincere actress and an amazing friend with whom there was not a single moment of boredom.
In 1992, it was relocated to 93° east, before being decommissioned in August 1993.
"We were waiting for her to pay us a visit since she was in the US with her son but instead, she bid farewell and left us all."
Built by Ford Aerospace and operated by the Indian National Satellite System, INSAT-1B was based upon a custom satellite bus developed for the INSAT-1 series of satellites.
Playwright Haseena Moin remembers her as an irreplaceable asset who always delivered the very best when it came to acting.
It had a mass at launch of , and was expected to operate for seven years.
"She was a lively character, very sweet and full of life.
The spacecraft carried twelve C and three S band transponders, powered by a single solar array.
On the set, she was Azra apa but when the camera rolled, she became the character she was playing and no one could say that she was the same person.
A stabilisation boom was used to counterbalance radiation torques from the satellite's asymmetrical design.
All her characters in my plays had shades of positive and negative characteristics and handling them was her forte.
The spacecraft was propelled by an R-4D-11 apogee motor.
She was one of those people who acted for their love of acting and not because of money, which is quite opposite to the acting scenario right now.
INSAT-1B was deployed by during the STS-8 mission.
Getting an actress of her calibre is not only difficult but also impossible.
"Challenger" lifted off from Launch Complex 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at 06:32:00 UTC on 30 August 1983.
The best thing about her was that she had no issues about her educated background as she easily donned the character of an aaya (Fazeelat) in Dhoop Kinaray while was also the rich begum sahiba (Apa Begum) in Tanhaiyaan."
INSAT-1B was deployed from the orbiter's payload bay at 07:48 UTC on 31 August, with a PAM-D upper stage firing shortly afterwards to place it into geosynchronous transfer orbit.
Badar Khalil was all praise and said she knew Azra Sherwani even before her marriage to Shahzad Khalil.
The spacecraft used its own propulsion system to raise itself into geostationary orbit.
“To me, she was a great human being and I can’t forget the way she loved me and my husband.
It received the International Designator 1983-089B and Satellite Catalog Number 14318.
She was very upset when my husband passed away since she regarded him as her son and also since he was the one who introduced her on television.
After some initial problems deploying its solar array, INSAT-1B became operational in October 1983.
After his death, she refused to work for TV for sometime since she felt that she couldn’t go near the TV station without Shahzad there.
It was located at 74° east for most of its operational life, before being moved to 93° east in 1992.
I still can’t believe that she is no more among us.”
In August 1993 it was decommissioned and raised to a graveyard orbit slightly above geosynchronous altitude.
Behroze Sabzwari became quite emotional when asked about her and said she was a great lady and learned people like her should grace acting since the art needs them.
Wolfgang Jüttner (born 21 March 1948 in Lüdersfeld) is a German politician, representative of the Social Democratic Party (SPD).
"I knew her for more than 30 years and I can't forget the love she gave to me.
He left the parliament 2013.
She was jolly on the set, while brave and loving in real life.
The following chart compares websites that provide U.S. credit reports and/or credit scores for free.
She treated me more like a son than a colleague as I was very young when I started acting.
Services limited to cardholders or only offering trial plans are excluded.
She was with me when we did Mera Naam Mangu and Saleem Ahmed's Tabeer and Bajiya's Aabginay.
The chart specifies what's free, what kind of credit reports are included, and whether a full Social Security number is needed.
All those who worked with her miss her but to me, she will always remain special."
According to the Federal Trade Commission, "AnnualCreditReport.com is the only authorized source for the free annual credit report."
Azra Sherwani was also associated with advertising and was part of renowned advertising agencies, churning out memorable commercials on TV and the print media as a member of the creative and client management departments.
Care should be taken when providing a full Social Security number to any other website.
Her viewers remember the pan-chewing, sari-clad and dominating Apa Begum who showed her anger by repeatedly saying: "Warna mujh se bura koi nahin hoga."

Mercer Ice Stream , formerly Ice Stream A, flows west to Gould Coast to the south of Whillans Ice Stream, Antarctica.
Over the years it has come serve as a memorial park for servicemen since World War I.
It is the southernmost of several major ice streams draining from Marie Byrd Land into the Ross Ice Shelf.
At Summit Avenue there is a large arch made of reddish sandstone, the only remnant of the Fourth Regiment Armory building that once stood at the site of the Jersey City Armory.
The ice streams were investigated and mapped by U.S. Antarctic Research Program personnel in a number of field seasons from 1983–84 and named Ice Stream A, B, C, etc., according to their position from south to north.
It was reconstructed in Pershing Field in 1941 and later named a Jersey City designated historic site.
The name was changed by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names in 2002 to honor Quaternary geologist John H. Mercer (1922–87) of the Institute of Polar Studies (now the Byrd Polar Research Center), Ohio State University, who mapped the moraines above Reedy Glacier and in the Ohio Range at the head of Horlick Ice Stream, the major tributaries to Mercer Ice Stream.

Fabio Machado was born in Funchal and started studying mandolin at the age of 9 years.
A children's playground is at the southern end of the park.
He joined the Madeira Mandolin Orchestra (Recreio Musical União da Mocidade) and became its Concertmaster for several years, performing in several venues as a soloist.He studied at the Conservatory "Cesare Pollini" in Padua, under the instruction of well renowned instructor and artist Dorina Frati.
Khalid Hamdaoui is a Dutch footballer (with ancestral roots tracing back to Morocco) who played in 2013 for Woodlands Wellington in the S.League.
In 1998, he toured central and northern Portugal, performing in Águeda, Vila do Conde, Benavente, Santarém and Expo 98.
He signed in the beginning of 2014 with Al-Nasr SC (Salalah), from Oman.
In 2002, he had a successful concert tour in the United Kingdom, performing in several English cathedrals such as St. George's Bristol, and in the St. George's Chapel, Windsor.
Khalid is comfortable in playing any position across the midfield and is a former Dutch Under-21 international.
This last concert was officially inserted in the celebrations of Queen Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee.
Born and raised in Amsterdam, Khalid was discovered as a youth prodigy while playing for non-league side, SC Overamstel.
Machado is mostly known for having performed some Caprices of N. Paganini, and the recording of a DVD playing ""Chaconne"" in G minor of Tomaso Vitali.
He was then drafted into the prestigious Ajax Amsterdam youth academy where he played alongside Roy Makaay and Rafael van der Vaart.
Besides having recorded 2 CDs and a DVD with the Madeira Mandolin Orchestra, he performs regularly in Italy, Germany, England, Portugal and the USA.
Upon leaving the academy, Khalid subsequently spent 2 seasons each for Eredivisie sides AZ Alkmaar and NAC Breda.
Machado is particularly fond of contemporary music and a mandolin work has been specially written for him by the Norwegian composer Oddvar Kvam, "A Special Day" for Mandolin and Piano.
In 2001, Hamdaoui made an important step to further his footballing career, travelling to Japan as an 18-year-old for trials.
The Battle of Preston (17–19 August 1648), fought largely at Walton-le-Dale near Preston in Lancashire, resulted in a victory for the New Model Army under the command of Oliver Cromwell over the Royalists and Scots commanded by the Duke of Hamilton.
The president of J.League side Tokyo Verdy 1969 was impressed by his Ajax Amsterdam background and he was offered him a contract.
The Parliamentarian victory presaged the end of the Second English Civil War.
Among Hamdaoui's colleagues in the Japanese team was the well-known Brazilian star Edmundo, who signed for Tokyo Verdy 1969 during the 2001 J. League Division 1 mid-season transfer window.
On 8 July 1648, when the Scottish Engager army crossed the Border in support of the English Royalist, the military situation was well defined.
After spending a year in the Portuguese Primeira Liga with O Elvas C.A.D. and another three seasons back home in the Netherlands with MVV Maastricht and FC Omniworld, Hamdaoui made the switch to Scottish First Division side, Dundee FC during the 2006–07 Scottish First Division season.
For the Parliamentarians, Cromwell besieged Pembroke in South Wales, Fairfax besieged Colchester in Essex, and Colonel Edward Rossiter besieged Pontefract and Scarborough in the north.
He made an impressive start for Dundee FC when he scored twice and created an assist for a teammate in a friendly match.
On 11 July, Pembroke fell and Colchester followed on 28 August.
Hamdaoui's first goal in the Scottish First Division would come against Clyde FC on 17 February 2007.
Elsewhere, however, the rebellion, which had been put down by rapidity of action rather than sheer weight of numbers, still smouldered.
In 2008, Hamdaoui decided to trace his ancestral roots and move to Morocco.
Charles, the Prince of Wales, with the fleet cruised along the Essex coast.
He subsequently signed a contract with Raja Casablanca on 5 August 2008, one of the most celebrated football clubs of North Africa, and won a Botola championship medal with the Green Eagles during the 2008–09 season.
Cromwell and John Lambert, however, understood each other perfectly, while the Scottish commanders quarrelled with each other and with Sir Marmaduke Langdale (the English Royalist commander in the north west).
On 14 January 2013, S.League club, Woodlands Wellington, announced that it had captured the signing of Hamdaoui after the Dutchman had impressed the management during his trial with the club.
As the English Royalist uprisings were close to collapse, it was on the adventures of the Engager Scottish army that the interest of the war centred.
On 21 February 2013, Hamdaoui made his debut for the Rams in a home game against Warriors F.C. where he outshone Kazuyuki Toda by scoring one goal and assisting Moon Soon-Ho to another, helping the Rams draw the match with a 2 – 2 scoreline.
It was by no means the veteran army of the Earl of Leven, which had long been disbanded.
Khalid's six-month contract ended with the Rams in June 2013 and his contract was not extended.
For the most part it consisted of raw levies and, as the Kirk party had refused to sanction The Engagement (an agreement between Charles I and the Scots Parliament for the Scots to intervene in England on behalf of Charles), David Leslie and thousands of experienced officers and men declined to serve.
He played 12 league matches for Woodlands Wellington and scored 4 goals.
The leadership of the Duke of Hamilton proved to be a poor substitute for that of Leslie.
On 5 January 2014, Khalid Hamdaoui signed a 1-year contract with Al-Nasr SC (Salalah), from Qatar.
Hamilton's army, too, was so ill provided that as soon as England was invaded it began to plunder the countryside for the bare means of sustenance.
"Khalid is the perfect player for the plans of Al-Nasr.
On 8 July the Scots, with Langdale as advanced guard, were about Carlisle, and reinforcements from Ulster were expected daily.
They were looking for that kind of player", said Robert Cristian Trif, Hamdaoui's agent.
Lambert's horse were at Penrith, Hexham and Newcastle, too weak to fight and having only skilful leading and rapidity of movement to enable them to gain time.
"He has terrific ability and craft" – Alex Rae, former Dundee FC coach.
Appleby Castle surrendered to the Scots on 31 July, whereat Lambert, who was still hanging on to the flank of the Scottish advance, fell back from Barnard Castle to Richmond so as to close Wensleydale against any attempt of the invaders to march on Pontefract.
Loretta Jones is a fictional character from the British Channel 4 soap opera, "Hollyoaks", and its spin-off series, "Hollyoaks Later".
All the restless energy of Langdale's horse was unable to dislodge Lambert from the passes or to find out what was behind that impenetrable cavalry screen.
The character is played by Melissa Walton and first appeared on-screen on 26 November 2008 during the first series of the "Hollyoaks" spin-off "Hollyoaks Later" as a new love interest for the character Dominic Reilly (John Pickard).
Cromwell had received the surrender of Pembroke Castle on 11 July, and had marched off, with his men unpaid, ragged and shoeless, at full speed through the Midlands.
She made her first appearance in the "Hollyoaks" series in February 2009 and was the first character to be introduced to the series by producer Lucy Allan.
Rains and storms delayed his march, but he knew that Hamilton in the broken ground of Westmorland was still worse off.
In 2010 Loretta was axed from the series, along with 15 other characters, during a cast cull by executive producer Paul Marquess.
Shoes from Northampton and stockings from Coventry met him, at Nottingham, and, gathering up the local levies as he went, he made for Doncaster, where he arrived on 8 August, having gained six days in advance of the time he had allowed himself for the march.
The character development has Loretta having worked as a pole dancer and Walton put extensive research into the role, including visiting strip clubs.
He then called up artillery from Hull, exchanged his local levies for the regulars who were besieging Pontefract, and set off to meet Lambert.
Despite this occupation Loretta has been portrayed out of conjunction with the blonde stereotype.
Hamilton was at Lancaster, and Sir George Monro with the Scots from Ulster and the Carlisle Royalists (organized as a separate command owing to friction between Monro and the generals of the main army) at Hornby.
She has been involved in storylines which include facing prejudice, body scarring issues and stalking fellow characters.
On 13 August, while Cromwell was marching to join Lambert at Otley, the Scottish leaders were still disputing whether they should make for Pontefract or continue through Lancashire so as to join Lord Byron and the Cheshire Royalists.
The character is most noted for the series intending to portray her as a child murderer trying to piece her life back together.
On 14 August 1648 Cromwell and Lambert were at Skipton, on 15 August at Gisburn and on 16 August they marched down the valley of the Ribble towards Preston with full knowledge of the enemy's dispositions and full determination to attack him.
The plot was subsequently axed having caused a great amount of controversy among the British public after newspapers alleged that the storyline was copying a real-life case.
They had with them horse and foot not only of the Army, but also of the militia of Yorkshire, Durham, Northumberland and Lancashire, and withal were slightly outnumbered, having only 8,600 men against perhaps 9,000 of Hamilton's command.
Loretta has been positively received by the media for her appearance and has been dubbed a "blond bombshell".
But the latter were scattered for convenience of supply along the road from Lancaster, through Preston, towards Wigan, Langdale's corps having thus become the left flank guard instead of the advanced guard.
Before Loretta's departure from the series Marquess made changes to the characters persona: portraying her as a stalker being obsessive, calculating and pretending to have leukaemia.
Langdale called in his advanced parties, perhaps with a view to resuming the duties of advanced guard, on the night of 13 August, and collected them near Longridge.
In her final storyline it was revealed that she had been sexually abused as a child and admitted herself to a psychiatric hospital.
It is not clear whether he reported Cromwell's advance, but, if he did, Hamilton ignored the report, for on 17 August Monro was half a day's march to the north, Langdale east of Preston, and the main army strung out on the road to Wigan, Major-General William Baillie with a body of foot, the rear of the column, being still in Preston.
The character of Loretta was created as a temporary love interest for Dominic Reilly (John Pickard) and was intended to feature only in "Hollyoaks Later", the spin-off from the "Hollyoaks" series.
Hamilton, yielding to the importunity of his lieutenant-general, James Livingston, 1st Earl of Callendar, sent Baillie across the Ribble to follow the main body just as Langdale, with 3,000 foot and 500 horse only, met the first shock of Cromwell's attack on Preston Moor.
In 2009 it was announced that the "Hollyoaks"<nowiki>'</nowiki> producer Lucy Allan had decided to introduce both Loretta and Cheryl Brady (Bronagh Waugh) into the main show.
Hamilton, like Charles at Edgehill, passively shared in, without directing, the Battle of Preston, and, though Langdale's men fought magnificently, they were after four hours' struggle driven to the Ribble.
Allan said, "Cheryl and Loretta will bring an energy and a sense of fun to the show.
Baillie attempted to cover the Ribble and Darwen bridges on the Wigan road, but Cromwell had forced his way across both before nightfall.
Both Melissa and Bronagh impressed me with their performances in "Hollyoaks Later" and I'm sure viewers will warm to them quickly."
Pursuit was at once undertaken, and not relaxed until Hamilton had been driven through Wigan and Winwick to Uttoxeter and Ashbourne.
Loretta was initially paired with Dom and, after ending their relationship, was given links to other characters in the series.
There, pressed furiously in rear by Cromwell's horse and held up in front by the militia of the midlands, the remnant of the Scottish army laid down its arms on 25 August.
To prepare for the role Walton took pole-dancing classes and visited a lap dancing club.
Various attempts were made to raise the Royalist standard in Wales and elsewhere, but Preston was the death-blow to the Royalist hopes in the Second Civil War.
After watching girls perform at the club she carried out routines in her underwear.
Cromwell estimated the Royalist losses at 2,000 killed and 9,000 captured.
She also had a pole set up in her living room to carry on practicing.
Those among the prisoners who had served voluntarily were bound for servile labour in the New World, and when there was no more demand there, for service in the Republic of Venice When the English Parliament decreed a day of thanksgiving for the victory, it was announced that Cromwell's army had "one hundred at the most" killed.
Speaking of her research Walton stated: "I loved it.
The Battle of Preston is depicted in Robert Neil's historical novel "Witch Bane".
It's really good exercise.
As noted by Neil in his historical note, it is difficult to reconstruct with certainty precisely where in Preston the battle took place.
It's really good for toning.
Both accounts are weak on topography, since neither of the military commanders knew the ground.
They didn't ask me to, but I did... I went and I had pole dancing classes.
Neil's protagonists are two women, caught up in the fighting, desperately trying to survive while also deeply worried about their respective lovers who are fighting on opposing sides.
I had a pole put up in my living room."
The topography is crucial to the plot's depiction of the women trying to escape the fighting.
Though Walton had initially signed on for a three-month stint Allan decided to renew her contract in 2009 and keep Loretta in the series until 2010.
Before writing, Neil studied extensively the existing sources and walked repeatedly around the battleground.
In early 2010 it was announced that Allan had stepped down from the position of executive producer and that Paul Marquess had taken over the role.
What Cromwell described as "A lane, very deep and ill, up to the Enemy's army and leading to the Town" is also mentioned by Sir Marmaduke, who blames his Scottish allies for having failed to secure that lane, whose eventual capture enabled the Parliamentary forces to outflank the Royalists.
It was soon revealed that Marquess planned to give Hollyoaks a "shake up", changing the productions team and beginning a cast cull by axing three established characters.
Neil's plot and the route taken by his protagonists is based on the assumption that this crucial lane followed more or less the line of the present A59 road through Brockholes to Blackburn.
Stephanie Waring (who plays Cindy Hutchinson) then revealed that all remaining cast members feared their own character would be axed.
Neil concedes, however, that other interpretations of the battle's topography are possible.
One month later Marquess announced his plans to axe a further 11 characters, including Loretta at the end of Walton's contract.
Blanche Honegger Moyse (September 23, 1909 – February 10, 2011) was a conductor who lived in Brattleboro, Vermont at the time of her death.
It was also revealed that Loretta would depart at the same time as her current love interest Jake Dean (Kevin Sacre).
She was particularly admired for her devotion to the choral works of Johann Sebastian Bach and her ability to draw deeply moving performances from both amateur and professional musicians.
On 8 June 2010 Walton filmed her final scenes for the series, along with two fellow cast members Scare and Gerard McCarthy (who plays Kris Fisher).
Soprano Arleen Auger has said of her, "I’ve sung Bach all over the world, often with people who are considered the best, and in my opinion no one is performing Bach any better than Blanche Moyse is doing it in Brattleboro."
She spoke of her upset over leaving her fellow cast members, but later said she was looking forward to pursuing other projects.
She had been pointed out by the writer Benjamin Ivry as perhaps having been "classical music's best kept secret."
Walton also confirmed that she was happy the door was left open for a potential return, stating that she would consider reprising her role as Loretta in the future.
Wall Street Journal critic Greg Sandow said of her performance of Bach's St. John Passion at the age of 89: "Sometimes you hear a concert that sticks with you.
Walton also said she understood why Marquess axed her character, he did not feel Loretta had anywhere left to go after the cancellation of her main storyline.
For months you think about it, keeping it alive in your mind, unable to banish it merely to memory."
However, she also felt like she deserved another chance to prove herself.
Moyse was born in Geneva, Switzerland, where she began the study of violin at the age of eight.
Loretta has stated on-screen that she does not want to conform with the stereotype of a blond pole dancer, and makes it clear that she is a keen bird watcher and enjoys documentaries.
She went on to study with Adolf Busch, and made her debut at the age of 16, when she played the Beethoven violin concerto with l'Orchestre de la Suisse Romande.
Speaking of the character Walton stated, "I love that Loretta's not a stereotypical stripper sort of girl—there’s a lot more depth to her.
She married the pianist and flutist Louis Moyse and, with Moyse's father, flautist Marcel Moyse, formed the award-winning Moyse Trio.
She’s actually quite shy and reserved.
In 1949, the Moyses moved to Marlboro, Vermont at the invitation of Busch and Rudolf Serkin, and helped found the Marlboro Music Festival.
She’s got lots of interesting little hobbies, like bird-watching and Roman history!
Moyse also chaired the music department at Marlboro College for the next 25 years, and founded the Brattleboro Music Center in 1952.
Then at night she skips off and turns into a stripper.
Her violin career ended in 1966 with an injury to her bow arm, but she went on to become a much admired conductor of the choral works of Bach.
It’s like two different lives, and I think many real-life pole-dancers are like that.
She made her Carnegie Hall debut at the age of 78, conducting the Blanche Moyse Chorale and the Orchestra of St. Luke's in a production of Bach's Christmas Oratorio, and she continued to conduct Bach's major choral works—the "Mass in B Minor", the "St Matthew Passion" and the "St John Passion"—at annual concerts of the New England Bach Festival well into her 90's.
They’re really nice, normal girls by day, and by night they turn into these temptresses."
In 2000 Blanche Moyse was awarded the Alfred Nash Patterson Lifetime Achievement Award by Choral Arts New England in recognition of her exceptional contributions to choruses and the appreciation of choral music in New England.
Walton also praised the soap's realistic portrayal of the occupation, saying that many pole dancers attend university or have good professions but rely on stripping for extra money, and that she has met people like her character in the strip club where "Hollyoaks" films scenes.
Moyse died at her home in Brattleboro, Vermont, on February 10, 2011 at the age of 101.
Walton hopes viewers will find Loretta's alter ego as a stripper tasteful commenting, "As tasteful as you can be in a pink frilly bra and knicker set, with a little skirt that’s more like a belt, and back-combed hair and fake eyelashes!"
Gudachari 116 is a 1966 Telugu spy film written by Aarudhra, and directed by M. Mallikharjuna Rao.
Loretta's stripper clothing is in stark contrast to her every day look of non-revealing clothing.
The film stars Krishna, Jayalalitha, Rajanala and Mukkamala in pivotal roles.
Loretta's relationships helped develop the character.
"Gudachari 116", the first spy film in Telugu and India, starring Superstar Krishna and Jayalalithaa, became such a smash hit that many sequels to the film were made in later years.
Her first relationship is with Dom Reilly who shares her interests in bird watching, documentaries on ancient Rome and literature.
In this James Bond style film, Jayalalithaa played a vamp-like character.
The relationship immediately gave viewers an insight into the character.
She was still at the beginning of her career, and this film brought out her talent and brought her recognition.
However, as their relationship progressed, it became apparent that Dom could not handle Loretta's profession as he feared for her safety, which ultimately lead to their break up.
Secret Agent 116 named Gopi has been assigned the case of the homicide of a fellow secret agent (303) by the head of CID.
Loretta's second relationship is a short-lived fling with Ravi Roy (Stephen Uppal) where she is determined to see the good in him, and help him while he suffers from a brain aneurysm, but ends the relationship when he attempts to assault her.
303 had found evidence that can help identify the perpetrators.
Loretta then begins a secret romance with Jake, who had tried to murder his child and rape his wife.
During this investigation, Gopi meets lovely Radha in a flight journey, and both end up falling in love with each other.
Loretta believes he had been misled and is still a good person, demonstrating Loretta's willingness to give people second chances.
The traitor responsible for the killing of agent 303 has gone to meet 303's sister Kamla and tells her that he is a CID inspector and investigating his brother's case, warning that her brother's killer may make an attempt on her pretending as his colleague and friend.
Walton comments, "[Loretta] is just lovely – she sees the good in everyone."
He elsewhere unsuccessfully continued on the life of agent 116.
When television listings magazine "What's on TV" challenged Walton to explain why Loretta would be interested in Jake after his crimes Walton said, "Loretta's big on forgiveness.
116 goes to meet Kamla and sees 303's portrait and notes down the studio photographer's name, but Kamla is convinced that 116 is the killer of her brother.
She believes Jake’s changed, that he's learnt from his time inside and he's paid his debt to society."
Kamla is approached by another mafia don, Damodar, for her help in eliminating 116, to which she agrees.
After Marquess decided to axe Loretta he changed the character's direction and her persona.
Damodar turns out to be Radha's father, when Radha introduces him, Gopi gets suspicious about him and commences a background check, which reveals that her father is a gangster.
She became obsessive over men, controlling towards Jake, manipulative and began lying to get what she wanted.
As he sets out his case against Damodar, he continues his romance with Radha.
Jake later decides he does not want her, of this Walton states that: "She's not going anywhere.
During Radha's birthday party, Damodar directs his henchman to kill 116, who escapes after some car chase.
She's deluded and manipulative and he hasn't seen anything yet!"
116 hesitantly reveals to Radha that her father is a gangster.
She also is shown have "bunny boiler" tendencies, with Walton agreeing to the label.
Heartbroken, Radha confronts her father, who tells her that he was forced into his life of crime and terrorism, and some other person controls them all, which was overheard by 116 and his assistant, who are hiding outside.
Walton later revealed that Loretta began pole dancing to have power over men because of the abuse she suffered as a child although, as Loretta's exit approached, she was now a dangerous and deluded woman.
116 goes out for his search for the real culprit to a skyscraper apartment where Kamla was plotted.
In November 2009 Loretta became the centre of media controversy when various media outlets announced that Loretta would be part of a storyline which revealed that she had murdered a child in her past.
Kamla seductively dances and mixes some intoxicant pill in his drink, which overlooked by 116, eventually made him senseless.
The controversy began when tabloid newspaper "The Sun" compared the storyline to the real life murder of James Bulger.
Goons take him to their secret den in the city outskirts, along with Radha, who mistakes them as Hospital Ward boys.
Bulger had been murdered when he was two years old by two young children.
In the den, 116 captures one of the goon leaders and forces him to reveal some information.
Being just 10 years of age they were handed small sentences to serve and were later released with new identities.
116 fights his way with Radha and escapes in a vehicle.
Soon afterwards various other news sources and lifestyle magazines picked up the story and mimicked "The Sun" and its claims.
In the meantime, CID agents trace a letter leading to clues regarding the Chinese conspiracy to destabilize the nation and accommodated by traitors inside, led by a person wearing a Mao uniform named Supremo, who only speaks a few broken English sentences.
Bulger's mother, Denise Fergus, condemned the storyline.
The rest of the movie follows 116's efforts to thwart a foreign conspiracy against India.
While speaking to the news website Click Liverpool she criticised the decision to air a plot that allegedly mirrored her son's death, stating they should have consulted her first.
Louis the Stammerer was physically weak and outlived his father by only two years.
She said, "I'm shocked and disgusted at what "Hollyoaks" is doing.
He succeeded his younger brother Charles the Child as the ruler of Aquitaine in 866 and his father in West Francia in 877, but he was never crowned Emperor.
They have clearly based this story on what happened to James and it's outrageous that they should do this without consulting with me in any way."
In the French monarchial system, he is considered Louis II.
She threatened to encourage a boycott of the show.
Louis was crowned king on 8 October 877 by Hincmar, archbishop of Reims, at Compiegne and was crowned a second time in August 878 by Pope John VIII at Troyes while the pope was attending a council there.
Channel 4 released a statement defending the plot, explaining it had nothing to do with any real life case: "The forthcoming storyline is not based on any real-life case and it will in no way seek to recreate real events.
The pope may have even offered him the imperial crown, but it was declined.
The storyline focuses on the psychological repercussions for two characters in the show who were responsible for the death of a 12-year-old girl in the past."
He was described "a simple and sweet man, a lover of peace, justice, and religion".
The storyline would answer questions for viewers who had been speculating on Loretta's secret past.
In 878, he gave the counties of Barcelona, Girona, and Besalú to Wilfred the Hairy.
It would reveal that Loretta had spent time in prison for her crime, was born with the name Joanna Norman, and is living under a false identity.
His final act was to march against the invading Vikings, but he fell ill and died on 9 April or 10 April 879, not long after beginning this final campaign.
Speaking about delving into her character's history Walton commented to entertainment website Digital Spy, "It took a little while and until now, we've known little about her.
On his death, his realms were divided between his two sons, Carloman II and Louis III of France.
Nobody in the village knows who she is or where she's come from.
During the peace negotiations between his father and Erispoe, duke of Brittany, Louis was betrothed to an unnamed daughter of Erispoe in 856.
She's just planted herself in the village knowing hardly anybody.
It is not known if this was the same daughter who later married Gurivant.
She's quite a mysterious character.
The contract was broken in 857 after Erispoe's murder.
I'm absolutely loving the opportunity to explore her backstory."
Louis was married twice.
Speaking about her reaction to the plot she continued, "I was like, 'Oh my gosh!'
His first wife Ansgarde of Burgundy had two sons: Louis (born in 863) and Carloman (born in 866), both of whom became kings of West Francia, and two daughters: Hildegarde (born in 864) and Gisela (865–884).
I was so shocked but absolutely chuffed to bits because this is what all actors want – something massive like this to sink my teeth into.
The Apusomonadida are an taxonomic group of protozan zooflagellates, that appear to be the sister group to the Opisthokonts.
I feel so privileged that they've trusted me with this story.
Together with the Breviatea, these form the Obazoa clade.
I know they've wanted to do it for a while and they've finally chosen me!"
It includes the genera "Apusomonas", "Amastigomonas", "Manchomonas", "Thecamonas", "Podomonas" and "Multimonas".
In the same interview Walton described the storyline, "Loretta and Chrissy were best, best friends through childhood.
There is an effort to clarify the relationships between these genera.
They were closer than sisters.
The U.S. China Policy Foundation (USCPF) is an American non-governmental organization that works to improve United States-China relations.
She somehow tracks Loretta down and turns up out of the blue after Loretta's finished a dance class.
The group believes that specific misunderstandings and mis-perceptions within both countries inhibit co-operation, and it seeks to discuss those.
What we learn is that when they were 12, they bullied a young girl and didn't stop until they killed her.
The group states that it does not advocate foreign policy decisions and does not try to influence government decisions.
They kept pushing and pushing and eventually killed her.
The late American ambassadors John H. Holdridge and Arthur Hummel, Jr. founded the group with Chi Wang in 1995.
Since then, Loretta and Chrissy have been completely separated from each other, their families and friends.
Throughout the 1990s and onwards, it assisted American businesses trying to work with the Chinese.
They've spent years in institutions having psychiatric and behavioural treatment."
is an advertising slogan coined for Pepsi at JWT by Anuja Chauhan in 1998.
Kevin Sacre, whose character was directly involved in the storyline, voiced his support for the plot stating: "I think the fact that it's the sort of thing that happens in real life means it's something that should be addressed.
It combines Hindustani and English, and literally meaning "This Heart Desires More", which later became a popular slogan.
Anyone who buries their head in the sand is a bit naïve.
The worldwide Pepsi commercial featuring the song, "Ask for More", written by Janet Jackson was released in November 1998, later released a single in January 1999.
And I think soap is a medium where you can explore issues of real life."
The slogan has its origins as a commercial slogan for Pepsi advertisement in 1998, at JWT by Anuja Chauhan who eventually became Vice President and Executive Creative Director at JWT, Delhi, and author of books like, "The Zoya Factor" (2008).
Just days before the episodes were set to transmit Channel 4 announced that it was axing the storyline, due in part to Fergus's reaction to the storyline.
Thereafter it soon gained mass popularity, and became a battle slogan and rallying cry, first used by Capt. Vikram Batra, an officer of the Indian Army, during the 1999 Kargil War and widely reported in the media.
Whilst Walton had previously claimed the storyline was about three twelve-year-old girls, Channel 4 admitted the similarities between the story and the Bulger case.
Captain Batra was martyred during the war in July 1999 was posthumously awarded the Param Vir Chakra, India's highest military honour.
"This particular storyline was not based on any real life case and was not intended to recreate actual events.
The slogan continues to be a part of the Indian popular culture.
However, after conversations with Denise Fergus we have agreed to amend certain aspects of the storyline."
In 2004, it was used as a title for a Bollywood movie, "Dil Maange More" starring Shahid Kapoor.
Amber Hodgkiss, who was cast to play Chrissy, expressed her disappointment over the decision to axe the plot all together saying, "The storyline has been completely cut.
The slogan was coined as a tagline for a Pepsi television advertisement series that first ran in December 1998 and sought to establish Pepsi as a strong brand with Indian youth.
I am not so happy about it.
It was a continuation of Pepsi's advertising campaign in the mid-to-late nineties, which it had initially launched as an ambush marketing effort against Coca-Cola during the 1996 Cricket World Cup.
I would like it to go ahead, but I don't have that decision.
The ads featured prominent sports personalities and film stars, such as Sachin Tendulkar, Shahrukh Khan, Amitabh Bachchan, and Pawan Kalyan and were directed by Prahlad Kakkar, a veteran ad film director.
It wasn't based on Jamie Bulger, but people portrayed it that way.
The catchphrase became a runaway success and other business entities sought to appropriate it in their messaging.
It was quite a big storyline that could affect people, but it happens."
Pepsi litigated actively to assert an exclusive right to use the slogan.
Fergus said she was grateful that the plot was axed saying, "I'm grateful that they are respecting my wishes.
Afroditi Krassa (born 1974) is a British Product Designer and Interior Designer and founded her own design consultancy Afroditi Krassa LTD in 2002 in London.
I made it clear that I did not want those scenes broadcast and I'm pleased to say they clearly understood my feelings."
Krassa was educated at Central St Martins College of Art and Design and later on, the Royal College of Art, under architect Ron Arad.
When episodes that were intended to feature the storyline transmitted, they instead featured a selection of then "last minute" scenes.
Afroditi Krassa was born in London, England.
In these scenes Hodgkiss portrays a new character, Caroline, who holds Loretta and Jake hostage.
She was raised near Mount Olympus in Greece.
Marquess began writing scripts to facilitate Loretta's departure as Walton's filming was to finish in June 2010, with a departure date of August that same year.
At the age of 17, she returned to her birthplace to become a designer.
Her exit from the series was described as dramatic, with Walton commenting on this during an interview with magazine programme "Live from Studio Five" stating, "I'm very pleased with my exit, you know.
She has worked at some of the world’s largest consultancies and was the first ever female designer to be employed by the design duo Seymour Powell.
I'm very, very pleased with what I've been given and I've really enjoyed doing it.
In 2002, Krassa decided to go it alone and founded Afroditikrassa Ltd.
I've probably enjoyed the last few months of filming more than I've enjoyed anything else that I've done, to be honest."
The young designer’s work was picked up by major brands such as Cassina, DKNY and design aficionados, such as Mourad Mazouz (Momo) of sketch.
Loretta's backstory gradually began to unfold on-screen.
In 2004 Krassa was commissioned by the entrepreneur Julian Metcalfe to design the interior and branding of sushi restaurant chain Itsu.
Loretta decided she needed to win Jake back.
The pioneering low fat food store rapidly grew into a chain of 19 stores in London and New York City.
Her ex-boyfriend Adam (Vlach Ashton) warned Jake that Loretta had previously stalked him.
She was then appointed Creative Director in 2005.
This starts to damage their relationship and during an interview with "What's on TV" Walton commented on it saying that Jake was suspicious of Loretta's motives.
Offers for the design of restaurant, office and retail establishments around the world followed soon after, as well as collaborations with various manufacturers, such as lighting for Ligne Roset and Innermost, furniture for E&Y, packaging for Pret A Manger and WMF, and products for British American Tobacco and Phillip Morris.
Loretta love for Jake turned into an obsession with Walton saying, "She's definitely not giving up on him.
When not designing, she teaches, writes about and judges design.
What he thought was love is already actually an obsession.
Her work has appeared in art and design publications worldwide and has been televised by the BBC, Channel 4, CNN and NTV.
She wants to totally control him".
Krassa's work ranges from political campaigns to car interiors and is always characterised by intellectual rigour and formal directness.
The story line reveals her past of obsessions with men and Walton stated, "You sense Adam wasn't the only ex-partner she stalked.
Helena Dvořáková or Helena Dvořák (born 30 January 1979) is a Czech actress.
She has a mobile full of men's numbers."
She was born in Brno, Czechoslovakia.
Walton explains the cause of her behaviour, "You find out much later on that it's because of something that happened in her past.
She studied at an academic gymnasium and later continued her studies of dramatic arts at the Janáček Academy of Musical Arts (JAMU) in Brno.
Her obsession really is getting full-on [...] She's jealous of anybody who gets Jake's attention."
She graduated from JAMU in 2002.
After Jake's sister Steph Cunningham (Carley Stenson) is diagnosed with cervical cancer Loretta pretends she once had leukaemia in order to trap Jake.
Following her studies, she spent five seasons at the stage of the City Theatre in Brno.
He throws her out though because his son had previously suffered from the illness.
Helena plays flute and singing in the choir and with folk band.
Loretta refuses to give up and her behaviour becomes more erratic.
It arises in the Puketeraki Range and flows south-east into the Waimakariri River near Christchurch International Airport.
In the final episodes of her departure Loretta manages to convince everyone that Jake was mentally ill once more.
The connection with the Waimakariri is via a diversion channel running south-west, replacing the Eyre's original easterly flow.
She takes Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox) hostage for snooping into her life with Adam and Walton states, "Loretta is dangerous and deluded, Nancy's terrified of her – she tries to escape but Loretta won't let her She accidentally pushes Nancy, who crashes into a table and bangs her head badly".
The river is named after Edward John Eyre, the Lieutenant-Governor of New Munster from 1848–53.
Walton also revealed more of Loretta's past saying, "Adam confesses that Loretta was violent towards him, basically she did some awful things to him that she's doing to Jake now."
The river rarely carries surface water, due to the unreliability of the easterly rains which feed it.
The storyline sought to explain all the unanswered questions left in her backstory with Walton saying, "He [Jake] tries to talk her round, and at that point she reveals she was sexually abused when she was very young.
Silver Blaze is a 1937 British, black-and-white crime and mystery film, based loosely on Arthur Conan Doyle's short story "The Adventure of Silver Blaze".
It's supposedly the reason she went into stripping to have power over men."
It was directed by Thomas Bentley, and was produced by Twickenham Film Studios Productions.
Walton also defended Loretta's final actions, saying the character was confused and did not mean to hurt anyone.
It stars Arthur Wontner as Sherlock Holmes, and Ian Fleming as Dr. Watson.
In Loretta's final scene she voluntarily admits herself into a psychiatric hospital after being convinced to by Jake.

Dom worries about Loretta's safety at her job and gives her a rape alarm, much to her amusement.
Aziz was a former militant commander turned "pro-freedom" politician.
Loretta reassures him, but realises how serious it is for him when he reveals that Tina's abduction and death has left him uptight about safety.
He had been jailed on several occasions for demanding accession of Kashmir with Pakistan.

She slips and falls onto some glass bottles which break and cut her stomach.
Sheikh Abdul Aziz was born in 1952 in Namblabal, district Pampore close to the capital city Srinagar.
Loretta is horrified when she is left scarred by the glass.
He was of Arab ancestry whose ancestors had migrated from outside to Kashmir.
Her boss sacks her, because her scars have rendered her unattractive, and Loretta is given a job in Tan & Tumble by Ash Roy (Junade Khan).
He received basic education from Government School Pampore and then passed Matriculation from Government High School Pampore.
Loretta develops a crush on Ravi Roy which makes his brother Ash jealous.
Soon after passing his Matriculation examination, Aziz joined the agriculture business of his father Sheikh Abdul Salam, including growing high yield saffron, for which his hometown is famous throughout the Kashmir valley.
After Loretta catches Ravi being violent towards his sister Leila (Lena Kaur) she distances herself from him and Ash starts flirting with her.

The Canada–Panama Free Trade Agreement is a free trade agreement between Canada and Panama that went into effect April 1, 2013.
Initially organised as a trade union council to be the labour wing of the People's National Party (PNP) in 1943, the organisation split in 1952 with the formation of the National Workers Union (which maintained alignment with the PNP).
The agreement was concluded on August 11, 2009 by Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli and signed by the two countries' trade ministers on May 14, 2010.
The TUC was a founding member of the Jamaica Confederation of Trade Unions.
The agreement was approved by both countries' parliaments by December 2012, allowing the agreement to come into effect.
The Trade Union Congress came into existence as a result of shifts in politics in Jamaica in the 1940s and early 1950s.
The agreement eliminates Panamanian tariffs on 90% of goods from Canada.
In 1943 differences between the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union (BITU) and People's National Party (PNP) led to the formation of the "Trade Union Council" which grouped 16 small unions together in alignment to the PNP, in contrast to BITU which was responsible for the foundation of the Jamaica Labour Party in that year.
The remaining 10% will be phased out within the next 10 years.
In 1946 the TUC was reorganised as the "Trade Union Congress" and in 1948 14 of the member unions were merged into a single union under the same name, with two unions remaining separate but affiliated.
Canada will remove 99% of its tariffs on goods from Panama.
Rapid learning (or Rapid eLearning Development) has traditionally referred to a methodology to build e-learning courses rapidly.
Canada will keep tariffs on some imports of sugar, poultry, eggs and dairy products.
Typically the author will create slides in PowerPoint, record narration on top of the slides, and then use software to add tests, or even collaboration activities between the slides.
Panama will end its ban on beef from Canada which was initiated after cases of mad cow disease were found in Canada in 2003.
The whole package is then sent, most often as an Adobe Flash file, to a learning management system or website.
In 2008, bilateral merchandise trade between Canada and Panama totaled $149.1 million.
E-learning has grown rapidly since the 1990s but developers and organizations were confronted by the complexity of authoring processes.
Trade has increased by 48 percent from 2007.
The difficulty and expense of building online courses from scratch led to the idea of recycling existing resources like Powerpoint presentations, and transforming them into e-learning courses.
Canada made up $127.9 million of total trade between the two countries, while Panama made up the remaining $21.2 million.
A traditional e-learning development project can take several months.
Both countries parliament needed to approve the agreement before it could come into force.
In contrast the aim of rapid e-learning is to build and roll out content modules within weeks.
The Canadian opposition parties had considered stalling the agreement over the issue of Panama being considered a tax haven.
For example, while one hour of standard e-learning can take 73 to 220 hours to develop, a PowerPoint to e-learning conversion can be estimated to take an average of 33 hours to develop.
The agreement was negotiated over four meetings.
In this usage, it refers not to how rapidly a module can be created by an e-learning developer, but how rapidly it can be viewed by a learner.
The first negotiation started in October 2008.
Most of them are authoring tools that include rapid learning as a feature.
The negotiations followed two exploratory meeting over a possible agreement.
Some of these tools treat each slide as a learning object and allow to add tests and online activities between the slides.
In 1998, Panama and Canada signed the Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement (FIPA).
Some of these software are online services, the others are desktop applications to install on your computer.
This agreement placed rights and obligations on foreign direct investments between the two countries.
A trend of the market is also to combine rapid learning (conversion of PowerPoint presentations) with screencast (filming your screen and your mouse movements) so as to provide both a sequence of slides and applications demos.
In 2006, FDI in Panama by Canadian companies was $111 million.
This combination is particularly powerful when authoring courses on how to use a software.
On May 14, 2010, Canada's International Trade Minister Peter Van Loan, along with Panama's Minister of Commerce and Industry, Roberto Henríquez, signed the Canada–Panama Free Trade Agreement (FTA), as well as parallel agreements on labour cooperation and the environment.
After 2000, a series of rapid learning tools were proposed on the market and became popular because of their simplicity and the feeling that anyone could build an e-learning course from a simple PowerPoint presentation.
On June 11, 2012 a bill to implement the trade, environmental, and labour agreements was introduced in the Canadian parliament as Bill C-24.
Some experts have highlighted the limits of this method or even insisted on the fact that rapid learning was the consequence of the misapprehension that if a face-to-face course worked well with PowerPoint, it would function equally well online.
The Manhood Suffrage League was a nineteenth-century ultra-radical and, later, socialist club.
This criticism of rapid learning development focuses on the idea that the richness of an interaction with students in the classroom is not encapsulated in a PowerPoint presentation file.
The organisation was founded in 1874 as the Democratic and Trades Alliance Association.
Rapid learning has been criticized for ignoring the axiom that people "learn by doing".
Most of its initial members were tailors or shoemakers based in Soho, many had been active Chartists and, later, supporters of James Bronterre O'Brien, and almost all were active in the First International.
More globally, the critics of rapid learning have followed the same track as the critics on the use of PowerPoint in education.
They included Maltman Barry, Johann Eccarius, Robert Gammage, John Bedford Leno, Charles Murray, James Murray, John Rogers, William Townshend and Henry Travis.
Many developers and organizations are able for the first time to build their online course without the help of an e-learning team (including instructional designers, art designers and other contributors).
In 1875, the club renamed itself as the "Manhood Suffrage League", taking its name from the northern section of the Reform League.
The overall evolution of internet practice and the development of the Web 2.0 collaboration scenarios might lead trainers to other scenarios.
Around this time, Frank Kitz came into contact with the group.
Rapid learning is seen an inheritance of the CD-ROM model and the idea that e-learning consists in an individual self-paced practice.
In 1877, Maltman Barry, by then the club's secretary, became an outspoken supporter of the Tory campaign to intervene in the Russo-Turkish War.
Students often complain that self-paced individual learning can be unengaging and offers little chances of interaction, correction and success.
Much of the group objected to this, and the organisation ceased to function by the end of the year.
This can be overcome through scenarios where the information is presented as rapid learning modules encapsulated in Flash SCORM packages or distributed on Learning Management Systems, and the learning activities developed through other tools, such as blogs, wikis, forums or videoconferences.
However, it subsequently revived, and by the early 1880s, it had become more interested in socialism.
She was born on January 28, 1885 in Memphis, Tennessee to James Levi Ewell.
The group became influential in the Marylebone Central Democratic Association and the Social and Political Education League.
She married Henry Ramond Tredwell of Port Washington, New York in 1905 in Brooklyn, New York.
League members Murray, J. D. Butler and James MacDonald all subsequently became leading figures in the Social Democratic Federation.
In 1908, she appeared in The Merry Widow at the New Amsterdam Theatre in New York City.
Reyneke Island ("Ostrov Reyneke") is an island in the Eugénie Archipelago within the Peter the Great Gulf of the Sea of Japan.
She divorced in Chicago in 1909.
It is administratively part of the city of Vladivostok in Primorsky Krai, Russia, and is located south of the city center.
In 1913 she appeared in the Century Opera Company's production of Aida in Manhattan.
Reyneke Island has an area of approximately and a population of 23 (2005), making it the smallest of four inhabited islands of Primorsky Krai both by area and population.
The Longsight International Festival (LIF) was an international cultural festival which celebrated the best of the Longsight area of Manchester.
Most residents live in the island's single settlement of the same named located on the northern coast.
The festival was organised by Life Plus an international NGO and it was supported by Manchester City Council.
Reyneke Island is a summer recreation location for the Primorsky Krai region, and tourism is an important part of the local economy.
LIF was an annual event; the first edition happened in July 2008.
The island is popular due to its pebbly and sandy beaches, the deciduous forest (oak, acer and tilia) on the western part of the island, and the meadows on the eastern part.
The LIF 2008 Festival took place in July 2008 at Longsight Library.
Pinales of the Korean pine variety are found on the island.
Longsight's Got Talent was also to be staged for the very first time and aimed to showcase the best of local talent.
The islet of Vykent Island and many kekurs are found around the coast.
Founded in 2003 as a result of Kyle Wiens not finding an Apple iBook G3 repair manual while the founders were attending Cal Poly, the company sells repair parts and publishes free wiki-like online repair guides for consumer electronics and gadgets on its web site.
Reyneke Island is connected to mainland Vladivostok by a ferry, operating three times a week in the warm seasons.
The company also performs product teardowns of consumer devices.
In addition to tourism, the island is also a local center for fish processing.
iFixit has released product teardowns of new mobile and laptop devices, which provides advertising for the company's parts and equipment sales.
Reyneke Island was named after Mikhail Reyneke, Vice Admiral of the Imperial Russian Navy and an early hydrographer of the Russian Hydrographic Service in the region.
These teardowns have been covered by "PC World" (now defunct), the "Mac Observer", "NetworkWorld" and other publications.
INSAT-1B was an Indian communications satellite which formed part of the Indian National Satellite System.
Co-founder Kyle Wiens has said he aims to reduce electronic waste by teaching people to repair their own gear, and by offering tools, parts, and a forum to discuss repairs.
Launched in 1983, it was operated in geostationary orbit at a longitude of 74 degrees east.
In 2011, he traveled through Africa with a documentary team.
At the end of its seven-year design life it was replaced by the newly launched INSAT-1D, dropping to backup status.
iFixit provides a software as a service platform known as Dozuki to allow others to use iFixit's documentation framework to produce their own documentation.
In 1992, it was relocated to 93° east, before being decommissioned in August 1993.
O'Reilly Media's "Make" and "Craft" magazines use Dozuki to feature community guides alongside instructions originally written by the staff for the print magazine.
Built by Ford Aerospace and operated by the Indian National Satellite System, INSAT-1B was based upon a custom satellite bus developed for the INSAT-1 series of satellites.
In September 2015, Apple removed the iFixit app from the App Store in reaction to the company's publication of a teardown of a developer pre-release version of the Apple TV (4th generation) obtained under Apple's Developer Program violating a signed Non-Disclosure Agreement and as such their developer account was suspended.
It had a mass at launch of , and was expected to operate for seven years.
In response iFixit says it has worked on improving its mobile site for users to access its services through a mobile browser.
The spacecraft carried twelve C and three S band transponders, powered by a single solar array.

Gerek Lin Meinhardt (born July 27, 1990) is an American foil fencer.
The spacecraft was propelled by an R-4D-11 apogee motor.
Meinhardt is one of two children born to Kurt and Jane Meinhardt.
INSAT-1B was deployed by during the STS-8 mission.
He attended Lick-Wilmerding High School in San Francisco for two years and completed high school in a home schooling program.
"Challenger" lifted off from Launch Complex 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at 06:32:00 UTC on 30 August 1983.
He attended the University of Notre Dame on a full fencing scholarship.
INSAT-1B was deployed from the orbiter's payload bay at 07:48 UTC on 31 August, with a PAM-D upper stage firing shortly afterwards to place it into geosynchronous transfer orbit.
He majored in business and finance, and was a member of the school's fencing team from 2009-2014.
The spacecraft used its own propulsion system to raise itself into geostationary orbit.
Gerek is currently employed by Deloitte Advisory.
It received the International Designator 1983-089B and Satellite Catalog Number 14318.
Introduced to the sport at age 9 through a program run by Olympic fencer Greg Massialas, Meinhardt began participating in national fencing competitions a year later.
After some initial problems deploying its solar array, INSAT-1B became operational in October 1983.
At age 16 he became the youngest men's national foil champion when he won the tournament at the 2007 U.S. Fencing National Championships.
It was located at 74° east for most of its operational life, before being moved to 93° east in 1992.
Ranked 16th in the world at the time, he participated in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing as a member of the United States fencing team.
In August 1993 it was decommissioned and raised to a graveyard orbit slightly above geosynchronous altitude.
At the 2010 World Fencing Championships in Paris, he won a bronze medal in the men's foil event, tying with Yuki Ota of Japan.
As of 14 November 2013, it is in an orbit with a perigee of , an apogee of , inclination of 14.69 degrees and an orbital period of 23.93 hours.

The following chart compares websites that provide U.S. credit reports and/or credit scores for free.
The incentive payment rate was the percentage needed to bring the national average return to producers (the market price plus the incentive payment) up to the annually set national support price.
Services limited to cardholders or only offering trial plans are excluded.
Each producer’s direct payment was the payment rate times the market receipts.
The chart specifies what's free, what kind of credit reports are included, and whether a full Social Security number is needed.
Producers with higher market receipts got larger support payments.
According to the Federal Trade Commission, "AnnualCreditReport.com is the only authorized source for the free annual credit report."
This created an incentive to increase output and to improve quality.
Care should be taken when providing a full Social Security number to any other website.

The company also runs projects related to advertising, elections monitoring and others.
Brandon Hall is a Greek Revival architecture style house built in 1856 in Washington, Mississippi, United States.
BelaPAN owns the on-line newspaper "Belorusskiye novosti".
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.
BelaPAN has received several journalistic awards, including the Dzmitry Zavadski Prize "For Courage and Professionalism" (2004), the Zeit Foundation's Young Press of Eastern Europe annual award (2005), and the Runet Prize as the best online Russian language source of news outside Russia (2006).
Majestic Brandon Hall was formally a large working cotton plantation located on the scenic Natchez Trace.
In December 2017, BelaPAN and "Belorusskiye novosti" have been mentioned among several other Belarusian independent media that had allegedly removed old news stories about the 2015 arrest and ten months long imprisonment of the businessman Viktor Prokopenya from their websites.
The land on which Brandon Hall now stands first passed into private ownership as a royal grant from the Spanish King Carlos III in 1788.
This was allegedly done after the media were approached by Prokopenya's public relations advisors.
In 1809 the property was sold at public auction to William Lock Chew for the sum of $7,000.
The situation has caused a wide discussion among Belarusian journalists and media professionals.
Chew constructed the first permanent dwelling consisting of a three-room brick house about twenty by sixty feet, built sometime between 1809 and 1820.
Tord Boontje (b. Oct. 3, 1968 in Enschede, Netherlands) is an industrial product designer.
This structure still exists as the "basement" of the present house known as Brandon Hall.
He graduated from the Design Academy Eindhoven in 1991 and earned a master's degree from the Royal College of Art (RCA) in London in 1994.
In 1833 Chew sold the property to Nathaniel Hoggatt, a successful planter whose daughter Charlotte inherited the land after his death.
After graduation, he founded his eponymous design company, Studio Tord Boontje.
On October 29, 1840, Charlotte Hoggatt married Gerard Brandon III, who was the son of an early Governor of Mississippi and the grandson of a Revolutionary War Hero of the same name.
In 2006, he created a special holiday collection for Target Department stores.
They lived in this original dwelling until 1853, when they began construction of Brandon Hall which was completed in 1856.
In 2009, he was appointed professor and head of Design Products at RCA and stepped down in 2013 after opening a store in London in 2012.
In January 1914, the plantation, house, and land was sold to George Hightower as a result of a default on a promissory note, thus ending an 81-year chain of ownership by the Brandon and Hoggatt families.
While head of Design Products at RCA, he increased the university's reputation by focusing on research while increasing student recruitment and academic leadership.
These 81 years extended from Mississippi's frontier days during the period of grace and plenty before the Civil War, and through the South's darkest hours after the war.

Lyon Hunter is a fictional character on the popular American daytime soap opera "As the World Turns", portrayed by Evan Alex Cole.
Michael Leslie Yorke was an Anglican priest in the last decades of the 20th century and the first years of the 21st.
Hunter first arrived in Oakdale after being promoted from the IT Department of Worldwide by Lucinda Walsh to become Emily Stewart's new co-editor at "The Intruder", when the decision was made to move the paper online.
He was born on 25 March 1939 and educated at Midhurst Grammar School and Magdalene College, Cambridge.
On his first day Hunter did not make a good first impression with Emily when it became apparent that he was quite clumsy and when Emily asked him if Hunter was his first or last name.
Ordained in 1965 his first post was a curacy at Croydon Parish Church after which he served as Succentor, Precentor and Chaplain at Chelmsford Cathedral.
He replied that it was his last name, and that his first name was not important, as everyone calls him Hunter.
Following this he was Rector of Hadstock, a Canon Residentiary at Chelmsford Cathedral, Vicar of St Margaret’s with St Nicholas, King’s Lynn and Provost of Portsmouth Cathedral.
Later when Emily started to get agitated at Hunter's suggestions for the site, including changing the name of the paper, she decided to head out to Yo's for a drink with Hunter following her.
In 1999 he became Dean of Lichfield, and is now in retirement as Dean Emeritus.
Once they were there Hunter once again put his foot in it when he commented on Emily's age by saying that people of her “generation” may not understand how the Internet works.
Home & Minor is an EP by Manchester-based alternative rock band Oceansize, released on 26 October 2009 on Superball Music.
As time went on Hunter once again showed his clumsy side by falling into Emily, with Alison, Casey and Jade looking on thinking that he is her new boy toy.
The release is limited to 3000 copies.
After Emily left, Alison went to talk to Hunter and told him that if he wants Emily to listen to him the best way is to just agree with her.
Regarding the EP, vocalist and guitarist Mike Vennart states, "we thought we’d try and make a mini-album of more reserved songs that have something in common with each other.
She then invited him to join her and her friends, but things do not go well when he accidentally knocks Jade's drink all over her and feeling embarrassed he quickly left.
It's our acoustic-like record, only there are no acoustic instruments and it’s not an album!"
When he got back to the office Hunter told Emily that he would met Alison and she s nothing like her, also having taken on board what Alison said Hunter told Emily that she was right about changing the name of the paper, and in doing so she started to warm to him.
Mercer Ice Stream , formerly Ice Stream A, flows west to Gould Coast to the south of Whillans Ice Stream, Antarctica.
As Emily and Hunter started working together on the new online "Intruder", he continued to point out every mistake she was making which frustrated her causing her to kick Hunter out of the office so that she could concentrate.
It is the southernmost of several major ice streams draining from Marie Byrd Land into the Ross Ice Shelf.
Later, Alison arrived at the office looking for Hunter and Emily told her that she has told him to stay away, when Emily asked what she wanted him for Alison told her that Casey was having a barbecue and she wanted to invite him, but also try to fix him up with Jade which Emily told her was not a great idea as Hunter would not know what to do if he had a girlfriend as she was raised by "cyber wolves in a techno forest".
The ice streams were investigated and mapped by U.S. Antarctic Research Program personnel in a number of field seasons from 1983–84 and named Ice Stream A, B, C, etc., according to their position from south to north.
When Alison found Hunter at Al's she invited him over to Casey but he was quite confused as to why she would want him there, but he turned down the invitation under the impression that Emily would need him to help her, so Alison told him that they would hang out another time; thinking this meant setting a date Hunter asked when but she had to explain that "another" time is only an expression, which again showed how literally Hunter takes everything in life.
The name was changed by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names in 2002 to honor Quaternary geologist John H. Mercer (1922–87) of the Institute of Polar Studies (now the Byrd Polar Research Center), Ohio State University, who mapped the moraines above Reedy Glacier and in the Ohio Range at the head of Horlick Ice Stream, the major tributaries to Mercer Ice Stream.
Afterwards Hunter went back to Worldwide to see how Emily was getting on and his continued to point out every mistake she made and she had to tell him that in order for her to get it right she would have to figure it all out on her own.
Roland Morillot (1885–1915) was a French naval officer and hero of the early age of submarines.
Wanting rid of Hunter again she told him to go to the barbecue that Alison mentioned which at first he was resistant to; however, when she said that if he did not leave one of them would die he quickly changed his mind especially when she told him that Alison had big plans for him.
Morillot captained the French submarine "Monge" when she was sunk by SMS "Helgoland".
As Hunter and Alison waited for Casey and Jade to arrive, they started talking and learned that they have quite a bit in common, when Alison suggested that he helped by grilling the meat and he started telling her the scientific effects of grilling which confused her, so she offered him a beer and he told her that he does not drink, and she asked if he does not like putting toxins into his body or if he has a sordid past like she does, when Jade and Casey finally arrived he welcomed them by emptying a bag of candy over her.
He ordered the ship evacuated and sunk with her as he made certain that his men escaped to safety.
As time passed Hunter showed that he is unable to recognize when people are being literal or telling a joke, and once again Jade become his target when he drops her burger on the floor, feeling out of place Hunter quickly makes his exit.
The entire crew was saved, except Morillot and two non-commissioned officers.
When he got back to the office he found that Emily had successfully formatted a page for the paper and she asked him how things went at the barbecue and he told her not very well.
The admiral of the Italian Navy awarded him the Gold Medal of Military Valour.
He then showed his interest in Alison and whether she and Emily have different fathers and she told him that they have different biological fathers and mothers, leading Emily to tell him that Alison is biologically her daughter and she explained how this was possible.
Three submarines were named in his honour.
When Alison found that she had taken Emily's MP3 player by mistake she called the office and he told her that it would get him out of the office Emily sent him to Casey's to switch them.
Fabio Machado (Funchal, Madeira, 1985) is a Portuguese mandolin virtuoso.
When Casey got a call to go into work, Hunter stayed behind to help her paint.
Fabio Machado was born in Funchal and started studying mandolin at the age of 9 years.
While Casey was gone Hunter asked Alison out on a date, much to her surprise, and she had to explain that she was dating Casey and it became clear that he had been misreading the signals and he went to leave but he walked into the paint resting on the ladder.
He joined the Madeira Mandolin Orchestra (Recreio Musical União da Mocidade) and became its Concertmaster for several years, performing in several venues as a soloist.He studied at the Conservatory "Cesare Pollini" in Padua, under the instruction of well renowned instructor and artist Dorina Frati.
Hunter went back to Worldwide and Emily was shocked to see the state that he was in, and he explained how he asked Alison out but she explained how Alison is seeing Casey, as she started to take Hunter's shirt off he shocked her with a kiss and he explained that he did it because he thought that she was coming on to him in a sexual way when helping him with his shirt later, Alison called to invite Hunter to lunch with her and Casey; however, when he arrived at Al's to see them kissing he decided not to go in and join them.
In 1998, he toured central and northern Portugal, performing in Águeda, Vila do Conde, Benavente, Santarém and Expo 98.
When Alison graduated from the nursing program, Casey and Emily decide to take her for a dinner, when Emily told Hunter of this he asked if Alison's father had been invited Emily told him that no one had bothered.
In 2002, he had a successful concert tour in the United Kingdom, performing in several English cathedrals such as St. George's Bristol, and in the St. George's Chapel, Windsor.
Thinking that this was just an oversight Hunter contacted Dr. Larry McDermott and when he told Emily of this she told him that Larry is the last person Alison would want to see.
This last concert was officially inserted in the celebrations of Queen Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee.
Hunter later turned up at the Lakeview to stand guard in case Larry decided to turn up, which Emily thought was weird and creepy and said that he has the "intimidation factor of a zygote", when Alison heard Emily telling Hunter to leave she told him to join them but she got a shock when she saw her father standing in the doorway.
Machado is mostly known for having performed some Caprices of N. Paganini, and the recording of a DVD playing ""Chaconne"" in G minor of Tomaso Vitali.
Confused as to why Larry was there Alison got upset especially when she learns that Hunter was behind it, when Hunter left the Lakeview he found Alison and Casey in Old Town and tried to apologize but Casey told him to stay away.
Besides having recorded 2 CDs and a DVD with the Madeira Mandolin Orchestra, he performs regularly in Italy, Germany, England, Portugal and the USA.
Larry later found Hunter at Java and got confused when he started reciting an apology written on a napkin, but he told Hunter that it was not necessary because even though it was not the best idea it did bring him back into his daughter's life, and feeling that it would help Hunter told Larry where he could find Alison.
Machado is particularly fond of contemporary music and a mandolin work has been specially written for him by the Norwegian composer Oddvar Kvam, "A Special Day" for Mandolin and Piano.
Having gone back to Worldwide Hunter again started his apology to a stunned Emily who found it to be a joke, seeing that he was sincerely sorry for his actions she told him not to worry, but that changed when she learned that he had sent Larry after Alison.
The Battle of Preston (17–19 August 1648), fought largely at Walton-le-Dale near Preston in Lancashire, resulted in a victory for the New Model Army under the command of Oliver Cromwell over the Royalists and Scots commanded by the Duke of Hamilton.
Emily then called Alison to see how she is and found that Hunter was off the hook as Alison was happy to get the chance to clear the air with Larry, then as Hunter went to leave Emily stopped him and got him to offer her half of his sandwich and told him that there may be hope for him yet.
The Parliamentarian victory presaged the end of the Second English Civil War.
When Hunter's mother suffered from a stroke it hit him hard and not wanting to go and see his mother alone Alison offered to go with him.
On 8 July 1648, when the Scottish Engager army crossed the Border in support of the English Royalist, the military situation was well defined.
When they got to Chicago, Hunter was worried about what to expect and Alison explained some of the possible symptoms, when the nurse came she told them that only one visitor was allowed at a time.
For the Parliamentarians, Cromwell besieged Pembroke in South Wales, Fairfax besieged Colchester in Essex, and Colonel Edward Rossiter besieged Pontefract and Scarborough in the north.
Hunter later came back and was in a state of shock after his mother told him that the man he always thought to be his father wasn't.
On 11 July, Pembroke fell and Colchester followed on 28 August.
Alison tries to reassure him that maybe the stroke had an effect on her memory, but he couldn't handle it and left.
Elsewhere, however, the rebellion, which had been put down by rapidity of action rather than sheer weight of numbers, still smouldered.
Back at Java Hunter told Alison about his childhood and how he never really knew his father and about his mother's career.
Charles, the Prince of Wales, with the fleet cruised along the Essex coast.
While hanging out with Alison, Hunter got a call from the home where his mother was staying saying that she was agitated so they headed out to Chicago to see her.
Cromwell and John Lambert, however, understood each other perfectly, while the Scottish commanders quarrelled with each other and with Sir Marmaduke Langdale (the English Royalist commander in the north west).
When they got to the home they saw that Aurora (Hunter's mother) was calm and sitting with the nurse, as he approached her she was excited to see him, and asked him to get her out of the home and called him Tristan which confused him and she got upset when he told her that his name wasn't Tristan and she got worse when she saw Alison.
As the English Royalist uprisings were close to collapse, it was on the adventures of the Engager Scottish army that the interest of the war centred.
Back at Java, Hunter and Alison discussed why his mother had called him Tristan, and he said that her favorite opera was "Tristan and Isolde", but she suggested that maybe Tristan was a past lover who she kept a secret with and he wondered whether Tristan was his father.
It was by no means the veteran army of the Earl of Leven, which had long been disbanded.
As they try figure it out Alison suggests that they look for his father which he agrees to although he was a bit hesitant to begin with, and he tells her that he’d never met anyone like her before which said was a mutual feeling on her part about him.
For the most part it consisted of raw levies and, as the Kirk party had refused to sanction The Engagement (an agreement between Charles I and the Scots Parliament for the Scots to intervene in England on behalf of Charles), David Leslie and thousands of experienced officers and men declined to serve.
When, Hunter finally decided that he was ready to look for his father he ran into an upset Alison in Old Town, but instead of comforting her, he made her feel worse.
The leadership of the Duke of Hamilton proved to be a poor substitute for that of Leslie.
Later they decided to go and see Aurora again; however, this time she's calmer and they play her favorite opera on a CD player and asked her about Tristan.
Hamilton's army, too, was so ill provided that as soon as England was invaded it began to plunder the countryside for the bare means of sustenance.
As they talked to her she started to cry and Alison told him not to pressure her, when he decided to leave she told him that his father's information would be on his birth certificate but he told her that he’d never seen it, so they headed to city hall to get a copy of it.
On 8 July the Scots, with Langdale as advanced guard, were about Carlisle, and reinforcements from Ulster were expected daily.
When he got a copy he told her that the name on the certificate for his father wasn’t Jeremiah Hunter the man he thought to be his father but that of a Tristan Wagner, so they decided to look him up.
Lambert's horse were at Penrith, Hexham and Newcastle, too weak to fight and having only skilful leading and rapidity of movement to enable them to gain time.
They later found the address of as Tristan Wagner in Chicago but when they got to his apartment they found that he couldn't possibly be Hunter's father.
Appleby Castle surrendered to the Scots on 31 July, whereat Lambert, who was still hanging on to the flank of the Scottish advance, fell back from Barnard Castle to Richmond so as to close Wensleydale against any attempt of the invaders to march on Pontefract.
Hunter was sitting in Al's when Alison found him and he told that she’d happily continue to find his father and he told her that his mother had died after suffering from another stroke.
All the restless energy of Langdale's horse was unable to dislodge Lambert from the passes or to find out what was behind that impenetrable cavalry screen.
Casey later turned up to talk to Alison but she wasn’t that open to listen, and when Hunter stood up to Casey for Alison, Casey lashed out at him.
The crisis was now at hand.
While Alison went to change her shift at the hospital, Emily and Larry arrived at Al's to talk, when she was finished with Larry Emily went over to talk to Hunter to see if he was going into work and she learned of his mother's passing.
Cromwell had received the surrender of Pembroke Castle on 11 July, and had marched off, with his men unpaid, ragged and shoeless, at full speed through the Midlands.
As they spoke Hunter told her of the mystery of his father's identity and of his mother's revelation, and when he told her of the name Tristan on his birth certificate Emily starts to suspect something and asks for Hunter's mother's name.
Rains and storms delayed his march, but he knew that Hamilton in the broken ground of Westmorland was still worse off.
After Hunter left Al's, Emily found that he’d forgotten an old program from an old performance of Tristan and Isolde and she started to investigate her suspicions, that Larry is Tristan and therefore being Hunter's father she later confronted him at the Lakeview to get some answers.
Shoes from Northampton and stockings from Coventry met him, at Nottingham, and, gathering up the local levies as he went, he made for Doncaster, where he arrived on 8 August, having gained six days in advance of the time he had allowed himself for the march.
Alison arrived at Hunter's room, he told her of his anger towards his mother and her revelation, and they got close and ended up kissing, until Alison stops them saying that she's still not over Casey and he's grieving and she told him that sleeping with him was tempting but would have been a mistake.
He then called up artillery from Hull, exchanged his local levies for the regulars who were besieging Pontefract, and set off to meet Lambert.
As Hunter and Alison talked things through Casey turned up and got the wrong end of the stick so Alison, and started to berate Alison for something she hadn’t done and Hunter stood up for her.
On 12 August Cromwell was at Wetherby, Lambert with horse and foot at Otley, Langdale at Skipton and Gargrave.
Later, Hunter turned up at Worldwide and started packing up his stuff and he told Emily that he's quitting, when he couldn’t find his coffee mug which Emily had taken h decided to leave it behind and she told him to call her before leaving and once he left she phoned her friend at the hospital lab and order a DNA test.
Hamilton was at Lancaster, and Sir George Monro with the Scots from Ulster and the Carlisle Royalists (organized as a separate command owing to friction between Monro and the generals of the main army) at Hornby.
After getting the DNA results, Emily turned up at Hunter's room and told him that he couldn't leave because she had to tell him something important.
On 13 August, while Cromwell was marching to join Lambert at Otley, the Scottish leaders were still disputing whether they should make for Pontefract or continue through Lancashire so as to join Lord Byron and the Cheshire Royalists.
As Emily tried desperately to get Hunter to stay in Oakdale he was extremely resistant thinking she only wanted him to stay so that he could help her at "The Intruder", but she told him that it had nothing to do with that and that she's his mother.
On 14 August 1648 Cromwell and Lambert were at Skipton, on 15 August at Gisburn and on 16 August they marched down the valley of the Ribble towards Preston with full knowledge of the enemy's dispositions and full determination to attack him.
Confused at her revelation Hunter takes it hard thinking that she's messing with him to get him to stay, but she explains to him how even though Aurora raised him she wasn't his biological mother, because he's her biological son in the same way that Alison is her biological daughter.
They had with them horse and foot not only of the Army, but also of the militia of Yorkshire, Durham, Northumberland and Lancashire, and withal were slightly outnumbered, having only 8,600 men against perhaps 9,000 of Hamilton's command.
Still not understanding what she was telling him Emily told him how her fertilized eggs were stolen and transferred to the University of Chicago where his mother worked, and she was then implanted with one of the eggs; however, Hunter still chose not to believe what she was saying to him.
But the latter were scattered for convenience of supply along the road from Lancaster, through Preston, towards Wigan, Langdale's corps having thus become the left flank guard instead of the advanced guard.
As she tried to get Hunter to understand Emily suggested that maybe because of her age Aurora couldn’t get pregnant in the traditional way and knew that Larry could help her but he's confused as to how his mother knew Larry, until Emily told him that Larry admitted being his mother's lover and that his money clip was engraved "To Tristan From Isolde" and he told her of how his mother once called him Tristan after her stroke and she promised to keep his secret forever.
Langdale called in his advanced parties, perhaps with a view to resuming the duties of advanced guard, on the night of 13 August, and collected them near Longridge.
Struggling to accept the news Hunter asked Emily for proof and she gave him the DNA results which confirmed that she's his mother and she tells him that he was a little wrong thinking he had no family in town, because he has her along with his grandmother Susan, his half-brother Daniel.
It is not clear whether he reported Cromwell's advance, but, if he did, Hamilton ignored the report, for on 17 August Monro was half a day's march to the north, Langdale east of Preston, and the main army strung out on the road to Wigan, Major-General William Baillie with a body of foot, the rear of the column, being still in Preston.
He then asked her about Alison and said that if Daniel's his half-brother then she must be his half-sister, but Emily explained that she's his sister as they have the same biological parents, which made him feel sick and he quickly left the room leaving a confused Emily behind.
Hamilton, yielding to the importunity of his lieutenant-general, James Livingston, 1st Earl of Callendar, sent Baillie across the Ribble to follow the main body just as Langdale, with 3,000 foot and 500 horse only, met the first shock of Cromwell's attack on Preston Moor.
Later, Alison finds Hunter at Java but when she reached out and touched his shoulder he quickly pulled away telling her never to touch him.
Hamilton, like Charles at Edgehill, passively shared in, without directing, the Battle of Preston, and, though Langdale's men fought magnificently, they were after four hours' struggle driven to the Ribble.
He then had to explain to her that nothing could never happen between them because, every time that he's with her the thoughts he has are those that one should never have about their sister, and he was confused to find that she didn’t know what he was talking about.
Baillie attempted to cover the Ribble and Darwen bridges on the Wigan road, but Cromwell had forced his way across both before nightfall.
Hunter then explained to Alison how they have the same biological parents, and they then discovered why they had some special connection, but he felt that he had to leave as the feelings he had for her were too toxic and strong, but she was willing to see where their new sibling relationship lead and that she understood what he was going through as she went through he same thing when she learned that Emily was her biological mother and that it didn’t change how she felt because, Susan was her true mother as she raised her in the same way that Aurora raised him, but was unable to accept it Hunter chose to leave town.
Pursuit was at once undertaken, and not relaxed until Hamilton had been driven through Wigan and Winwick to Uttoxeter and Ashbourne.
Afterwards, Alison went to see Emily and told her how Hunter thought he was in love with her, much to Emily's horror and she gets even more hurt when Alison tells her how Hunter left, because she wanted a new child and now she learned that she already had one.
There, pressed furiously in rear by Cromwell's horse and held up in front by the militia of the midlands, the remnant of the Scottish army laid down its arms on 25 August.
Wanting to find some kind of clue as to where Hunter was Emily, went to his room and was shocked to find that Hunter hadn't left but was asleep under a load of clothes in his bed and was a bit worse for wear.
Various attempts were made to raise the Royalist standard in Wales and elsewhere, but Preston was the death-blow to the Royalist hopes in the Second Civil War.
As she tried to help him he told her to stop acting like his mother and she again reiterated how he's stuck with her whether he liked it or not, and he hurts her by saying that even though they have some biological connection he wants nothing to do with her.
Cromwell estimated the Royalist losses at 2,000 killed and 9,000 captured.
Not wanting to pressure Hunter, Emily told him that all she wants is to be a close friend of his, and asked him to go for lunch with her; while she waited for him to get ready Emily phoned Alison to come with them along with Susan.
Those among the prisoners who had served voluntarily were bound for servile labour in the New World, and when there was no more demand there, for service in the Republic of Venice When the English Parliament decreed a day of thanksgiving for the victory, it was announced that Cromwell's army had "one hundred at the most" killed.
Later Emily and Hunter head to the Lakeview to meet Susan and first Susan thought that Emily was repeating her mistake with Casey, until Emily explained how Hunter is her son because one of her fertilized eggs was given to Hunter's mother.
The Battle of Preston is depicted in Robert Neil's historical novel "Witch Bane".
When Alison arrived along with Larry, Susan gets confused as to why the latest family revelation concerned him and is shocked and angered when she learns that he's Hunter's biological father, especially as everything happened when he was still married to her.
As noted by Neil in his historical note, it is difficult to reconstruct with certainty precisely where in Preston the battle took place.
When Larry told Hunter that he would like to be a father to him, he got upset and left telling them all, that he doesn’t want anything to do with them and Alison followed him out.
The only contemporary accounts with much authority are those of Sir Marmaduke Langdale
When she caught up with him in Old Town, and she tells him that he shouldn’t run away from his newfound family and that they should accept their new relationship and that she's ready to have a brother in her life and how Emily and Susan are always there when you need them.
and of Cromwell in his letter to Mr. Speaker Lenthall.
Later they went back to the Lakeview and they see that Larry's gone after literally being kicked out by Susan, but Emily says that they should focus on the fact that Hunter's now officially a part of the Stewart family but he told her not to push it.
Both accounts are weak on topography, since neither of the military commanders knew the ground.
After finishing lunch Hunter tells Alison that it may be awhile before he can consider them all family but she tells him that despite the Stewarts' reputation in Oakdale they’re not that bad, and she told him that they don't take being alone lightly in the family so he should just get used to it.
Neil's protagonists are two women, caught up in the fighting, desperately trying to survive while also deeply worried about their respective lovers who are fighting on opposing sides.
When Riley (Adam) turned up at the Lakeview he initially thinks that she and Hunter are together, but she explains that he's really her brother.
The topography is crucial to the plot's depiction of the women trying to escape the fighting.
He asked her whether Casey knew as it would help them because he can’t be jealous of Hunter if he's her brother but she says that it won’t change anything.
Before writing, Neil studied extensively the existing sources and walked repeatedly around the battleground.
Casey later turned up at Memorial after learning of Alison and Hunter's new connection but he failed to apologise in an appropriate way and Hunter told him to take a hint as Alison didn’t need him in her life.
What Cromwell described as "A lane, very deep and ill, up to the Enemy's army and leading to the Town" is also mentioned by Sir Marmaduke, who blames his Scottish allies for having failed to secure that lane, whose eventual capture enabled the Parliamentary forces to outflank the Royalists.
After, Alison explained to Casey that they had broken up when he walked into Hunter's room, and she told him that she doesn’t need him in her life.
Neil's plot and the route taken by his protagonists is based on the assumption that this crucial lane followed more or less the line of the present A59 road through Brockholes to Blackburn.
After cutting her ties with Casey, Hunter tried to comfort Alison but when he put his arm around her things got extremely awkward and he left.
Neil concedes, however, that other interpretations of the battle's topography are possible.
While Hunter was formatting pages on the website he was shocked to see Larry enter the office to see him, and he offers to give Hunter something of his mother's but Emily arrives before he can answer.
(Quotes from Neil's historical note are from Robert Neil, "Witch Bane", Arrow Books, London 1968.)
When Emily started berating Larry and telling him to stay away from her family Hunter, told her that he didn’t need her to defend him.
Blanche Honegger Moyse (September 23, 1909 – February 10, 2011) was a conductor who lived in Brattleboro, Vermont at the time of her death.
Hunter then accepted the gift Larry had which was an old music box of his mother's, Emily then told him to leave and Hunter agreed.
She was particularly admired for her devotion to the choral works of Johann Sebastian Bach and her ability to draw deeply moving performances from both amateur and professional musicians.
After, Hunter decided to stay busy with work but got upset when he thought of how his mother kept everything special to her from him, and Emily told her that he is not alone as he has family, but he continued to reject her as his mother.
Soprano Arleen Auger has said of her, "I’ve sung Bach all over the world, often with people who are considered the best, and in my opinion no one is performing Bach any better than Blanche Moyse is doing it in Brattleboro."
Hunter then went to find Alison at Memorial and invited her to lunch but she told him that she is going to Casey's party which he doesn’t take well as he doesn’t understand why it's still important to her; in the end to help her Hunter decided to go to the party with her.
She had been pointed out by the writer Benjamin Ivry as perhaps having been "classical music's best kept secret."
When they got to party Margo and everyone else were wondering how Alison knew Hunter and he explained how he's her brother much to everyone's amazement, especially Lisa who wondered how Susan could have a child that no one knew about, so Alison and Hunter explain about the situation with the stolen fertilized eggs, which made Larry his biological father and Emily his biological mother.
Wall Street Journal critic Greg Sandow said of her performance of Bach's St. John Passion at the age of 89: "Sometimes you hear a concert that sticks with you.
After Tom told Hunter that he should meet his half-brother Daniel, and without knowing the details Hunter asks Tom if he was married to Emily much to Margo's horror and when he asked how he could have a child with Emily not having been married to her things get a bit awkward.
For months you think about it, keeping it alive in your mind, unable to banish it merely to memory."
When Casey arrived and saw that Alison has come he was happy to see her and to help them Adam distracted Hunter to give them time alone, when they went outside Hunter continued to spy on them and got agitated when he saw them getting close, he then told her that it was time to leave but she chose to stay behind with Casey so he left alone.
Moyse was born in Geneva, Switzerland, where she began the study of violin at the age of eight.
Emily later found Hunter at the office and tried to talk to him about his grief and how it's hard for everyone but that you have to move on in time, and she told him how she's not trying to replace his mother and that even if they couldn’t be family that maybe they could be good friends and see how things go, but he doesn’t give her an answer.
She went on to study with Adolf Busch, and made her debut at the age of 16, when she played the Beethoven violin concerto with l'Orchestre de la Suisse Romande.
At the office, Emily told Hunter that was working on a story but was going to get some breakfast and he wondered why she was always trying to feed him but she offered to go for a working breakfast with him, but he said that he had to take care of his mother's ashes and she got a strange feeling knowing that his mother was in the office and she told him to figure something out as it was too crowded for the three of them.
She married the pianist and flutist Louis Moyse and, with Moyse's father, flautist Marcel Moyse, formed the award-winning Moyse Trio.
While he was working Lucinda turned up at the office looking for Emily and he told her his plans for "The Intruder".
In 1949, the Moyses moved to Marlboro, Vermont at the invitation of Busch and Rudolf Serkin, and helped found the Marlboro Music Festival.
Later Hunter went to find Emily at Al's as she was talking to Paul to tell her that Lucinda was looking for her.
Moyse also chaired the music department at Marlboro College for the next 25 years, and founded the Brattleboro Music Center in 1952.
When Emily finds Lucinda she was shocked to learn that her job was no longer available and that Hunter would be taking over, which she saw as a way of him putting her in her place, and she told him that if her didn't want her to be his mom that was fine but he didn't have to get her fired.
Her violin career ended in 1966 with an injury to her bow arm, but she went on to become a much admired conductor of the choral works of Bach.
When Emily walked out of the office Lucinda told Hunter to let her go and he berated her for firing Emily as she is "The Intruder" which Lucinda failed to acknowledge, and even though he loved his job, in support of Emily, Hunter quit.
She made her Carnegie Hall debut at the age of 78, conducting the Blanche Moyse Chorale and the Orchestra of St. Luke's in a production of Bach's Christmas Oratorio, and she continued to conduct Bach's major choral works—the "Mass in B Minor", the "St Matthew Passion" and the "St John Passion"—at annual concerts of the New England Bach Festival well into her 90's.
Marián Olejník (born 1976) is a Slovak slalom canoeist who competed at the international level from 1993 to 2007.
In 2000 Blanche Moyse was awarded the Alfred Nash Patterson Lifetime Achievement Award by Choral Arts New England in recognition of her exceptional contributions to choruses and the appreciation of choral music in New England.
He won three medals at the ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships with two silvers (C2: 2005, C2 team: 1999) and a bronze (C2 team: 2006).
Moyse died at her home in Brattleboro, Vermont, on February 10, 2011 at the age of 101.
At the European Championships he has won a total of 5 medals (2 golds, 1 silver and 2 bronzes).

Kamla seductively dances and mixes some intoxicant pill in his drink, which overlooked by 116, eventually made him senseless.
The school will cater both to the schooling needs of the children of Mahindra World City employees/residents as well as of those residing in surrounding areas.
Goons take him to their secret den in the city outskirts, along with Radha, who mistakes them as Hospital Ward boys.
Designed by the architect, Hafeez, the school is spread over a 5-acre (20,000 m2) campus nestled amidst sylvan surroundings.
In the den, 116 captures one of the goon leaders and forces him to reveal some information.
The school has received the National School Sanitation Award in 2012.
116 fights his way with Radha and escapes in a vehicle.

In the meantime, CID agents trace a letter leading to clues regarding the Chinese conspiracy to destabilize the nation and accommodated by traitors inside, led by a person wearing a Mao uniform named Supremo, who only speaks a few broken English sentences.
It is home to over 1,500 engineers and designers working in one of the most modern automobile and tractor R&D facility in India.
The rest of the movie follows 116's efforts to thwart a foreign conspiracy against India.
There is a mosque constructed by United Islamic Welfare Association (UNIWAS) inside Mahindra city situated in Blossom avenue besides Downtown stay in the road opposite to Canopy.
There are 6 songs in the film.
The Mahindra Group has plans to replicate this model of an integrated business city with industrial, residential and social infrastructure at Gummidipoondi in north part of Chennai.
Louis the Stammerer (1 November 846 – 10 April 879) was the King of Aquitaine and later the King of West Francia.
The Gummidipoondi facility will cover 1,000 acres (4.0 km2) abutting NH5 will mainly focus on Domestic Tariff Area (DTA).
He was the eldest son of emperor Charles the Bald and Ermentrude of Orléans.
The qualification and final rounds took place on September 18, 20 and 24th at the Olympic Gymnastics Hall.
Louis the Stammerer was physically weak and outlived his father by only two years.
Eighty-nine gymnasts competed in the horizontal bar event during the compulsory and optional rounds on September 18 and 20.
He succeeded his younger brother Charles the Child as the ruler of Aquitaine in 866 and his father in West Francia in 877, but he was never crowned Emperor.
The eight highest scoring gymnasts advanced to the final on September 24.
In the French monarchial system, he is considered Louis II.
Each country was limited to two competitors in the final.
Louis was crowned king on 8 October 877 by Hincmar, archbishop of Reims, at Compiegne and was crowned a second time in August 878 by Pope John VIII at Troyes while the pope was attending a council there.
Half of the points earned by each gymnast during both the compulsory and optional rounds carried over to the final.
The pope may have even offered him the imperial crown, but it was declined.
This constitutes the "prelim" score.
Louis had relatively little impact on politics.
(Lucius) Valerius Maximus (Basilius) (fl. 4th century) was a Roman senator who was appointed consul in AD 327.
He was described "a simple and sweet man, a lover of peace, justice, and religion".
Valerius Maximus was a member of the fourth century patrician gens Valeria, and probably the son of Valerius Maximus Basilius, urban prefect of Rome in 319.
In 878, he gave the counties of Barcelona, Girona, and Besalú to Wilfred the Hairy.
He served as the "Vicarius Orientis" in AD 325 before being appointed the eastern Praetorian prefect, probably in late 326, when the emperor Constantine I returned from Italy.
His final act was to march against the invading Vikings, but he fell ill and died on 9 April or 10 April 879, not long after beginning this final campaign.
This was an unusual appointment, as the office of Praetorian prefect was reserved for members of the Equestrian order, not senators, and it displayed the emperor’s confidence in Valerius Maximus, allowing him to exercise command over the extensive resources of the east.
On his death, his realms were divided between his two sons, Carloman II and Louis III of France.
He continued to serve Constantine in this role throughout 327 and 328, relinquishing the office in early 329 after Constantine returned from Gaul.
During the peace negotiations between his father and Erispoe, duke of Brittany, Louis was betrothed to an unnamed daughter of Erispoe in 856.
During this period, in AD 327, Valerius Maximus was appointed "consul posterior", alongside Flavius Constantius.
It is not known if this was the same daughter who later married Gurivant.
Then in late AD 331, he was probably sent to Gaul with the "Caesar" Constantius II, serving as Constantius’ Praetorian Prefect.
The contract was broken in 857 after Erispoe's murder.
Valerius Maximus served him there until late 333 or early 334, when Constantius returned to his father’s court at Constantinople.
Louis was married twice.
In around AD 336, Valerius Maximus was appointed Praetorian Prefect for a third time, this time accompanying the "Caesar" Dalmatius to the provinces along the Danubian frontier, which had been assigned to him as the territory he was to manage, in Constantine’s planned administrative division of the empire.
His first wife Ansgarde of Burgundy had two sons: Louis (born in 863) and Carloman (born in 866), both of whom became kings of West Francia, and two daughters: Hildegarde (born in 864) and Gisela (865–884).
He served under Dalmatius until 337, when Valerius Maximus was replaced shortly before the murder of Dalmatius in the wake of the death of Constantine I.
His second wife Adelaide of Paris had one daughter, Ermentrude (875–914) and a posthumous son, Charles the Simple, who would become, long after his elder brothers' deaths, king of West Francia.
It is speculated that Valerius Maximus was married twice.
The Apusomonadida are an taxonomic group of protozan zooflagellates, that appear to be the sister group to the Opisthokonts.
They possibly had one son together, named Lucius Valerius Septimius Bassus.
Together with the Breviatea, these form the Obazoa clade.
It has been postulated that they had two children, a son, Valerius Maximus Basilius, and a daughter, Valeria, who may have become a Christian through her possible marriage to a Rufius Maecius Placidus.
It includes the genera "Apusomonas", "Amastigomonas", "Manchomonas", "Thecamonas", "Podomonas" and "Multimonas".
The Lauenburg Lakes Nature Park  was founded in 1961 and lies in the district of Lauenburg in the southeastern part of the German state of Schleswig-Holstein.
There is an effort to clarify the relationships between these genera.
It is right on the border with the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in the Schleswig-Holstein Uplands, a Young Drift moraine landscape that formed during the Weichselian glaciation of the last ice age.
The U.S. China Policy Foundation (USCPF) is an American non-governmental organization that works to improve United States-China relations.
With an area of over 470 km the nature park is the third largest in Schleswig-Holstein and contains extensive stretches of forest.
The group believes that specific misunderstandings and mis-perceptions within both countries inhibit co-operation, and it seeks to discuss those.
The Lauenburg Lakes Nature Park, there are 40 lakes in total, borders directly on the Mecklenburg biosphere reserve of Schaalsee and, together, they form a large nature reserve along the former Inner German Border.
The group states that it does not advocate foreign policy decisions and does not try to influence government decisions.
The largest lakes in the nature park are the Ratzeburger See and the Schaalsee, which are linked together by the Schaalsee Canal that begins near Salem.
The late American ambassadors John H. Holdridge and Arthur Hummel, Jr. founded the group with Chi Wang in 1995.
The Old Salt Road from Lüneburg to Lübeck runs through the nature park – at several places, such as Fredeburg, still as a medieval route - the Alte Salzstraße.
Throughout the 1990s and onwards, it assisted American businesses trying to work with the Chinese.
The nature park is roughly bordered to the west between Berkenthin and Büchen by the Elbe-Lübeck Canal.
Yeh Dil Maange More!
The Naturparkweg nature trail runs through the park and links it to the other four nature parks in Schleswig-Holstein.
is an advertising slogan coined for Pepsi at JWT by Anuja Chauhan in 1998.
The watershed between the North and Baltic Seas also runs through the nature park.
It combines Hindustani and English, and literally meaning "This Heart Desires More", which later became a popular slogan.
The United States' Federal Bureau of Investigation instituted an Honorary Medals Program in 1989 as a way of recognizing "exceptional acts" by FBI employees and other law enforcement personnel working with the FBI.
The slogan and its derivatives have been used in multiple contexts in India.
These medals were created to supplement the then-existing reward system within the Bureau.
The worldwide Pepsi commercial featuring the song, "Ask for More", written by Janet Jackson was released in November 1998, later released a single in January 1999.
There are four medals in the program intended for personnel: the FBI Star, the FBI Medal for Meritorious Achievement, the FBI Shield of Bravery, and the FBI Medal of Valor.
The slogan has its origins as a commercial slogan for Pepsi advertisement in 1998, at JWT by Anuja Chauhan who eventually became Vice President and Executive Creative Director at JWT, Delhi, and author of books like, "The Zoya Factor" (2008).
One additional medal, the FBI Memorial Star, is for a surviving relative when a death has occurred in the line of duty.
Thereafter it soon gained mass popularity, and became a battle slogan and rallying cry, first used by Capt. Vikram Batra, an officer of the Indian Army, during the 1999 Kargil War and widely reported in the media.
These medals are considered to be among the highest honors granted by the FBI, and fewer than 400 had been awarded as of March 2009.
Captain Batra was martyred during the war in July 1999 was posthumously awarded the Param Vir Chakra, India's highest military honour.
"The FBI Star is awarded for serious injury sustained in the direct line of duty from physical confrontation with criminal adversaries, an injury inflicted by weapons, gunshot wounds inflicted in the line of duty, or an injury so severe that it would require substantial emergency room sutures, hospitalization, or comprehensive medical treatment for a sustained period of time."
The slogan continues to be a part of the Indian popular culture.
One recipient of the FBI Star is Major Peter Norton of the British Army, who was severely injured when he triggered a secondary explosive device while attempting to clear an area where five American soldiers had been killed by a roadside bomb.
In 2004, it was used as a title for a Bollywood movie, "Dil Maange More" starring Shahid Kapoor.
Norton was also awarded the George Cross—the highest British award for acts of gallantry which did not take place in action directly against enemy forces, and also awarded for civilian gallantry—for this incident.
The slogan was coined as a tagline for a Pepsi television advertisement series that first ran in December 1998 and sought to establish Pepsi as a strong brand with Indian youth.
"The FBI Medal for Meritorious Achievement is awarded for extraordinary and exceptional meritorious service in a duty of extreme challenge and great responsibility, extraordinary and exceptional achievements in connection with criminal or national security cases or projects, or a decisive, exemplary act that results in the protection or the direct saving of life in severe jeopardy in the line of duty."
It was a continuation of Pepsi's advertising campaign in the mid-to-late nineties, which it had initially launched as an ambush marketing effort against Coca-Cola during the 1996 Cricket World Cup.
Supervisory Special Agent Harold Bickmore of the FBI was awarded the Medal for Meritorious Achievement for saving the life of a sixteen-year-old girl whom he found on the ground not breathing at the scene of a traffic accident on a major four-lane highway.
The ads featured prominent sports personalities and film stars, such as Sachin Tendulkar, Shahrukh Khan, Amitabh Bachchan, and Pawan Kalyan and were directed by Prahlad Kakkar, a veteran ad film director.
He administered first aid on the spot, including CPR without any protection from blood-borne disease.
The catchphrase became a runaway success and other business entities sought to appropriate it in their messaging.
"The FBI Shield of Bravery is presented for brave and courageous acts occurring in the line of duty or within the scope of FBI employment which may extend to major assistance to a task force or undercover operation, grave situations, or crisis confrontations associated with the highest priority cases of the FBI."
Pepsi litigated actively to assert an exclusive right to use the slogan.
Shields of Bravery were awarded to Special Agent Ronald Eowan Sr, Regional Security Officer Earl Miller of the State Department, and former Special Agent Paul Myers.
Afroditi Krassa (born 1974) is a British Product Designer and Interior Designer and founded her own design consultancy Afroditi Krassa LTD in 2002 in London.
They spent nearly four years in Indonesia under primitive conditions orchestrating a "highly complex ruse" that led to the arrests of 12 terrorists and the disruption of their network.
Krassa was educated at Central St Martins College of Art and Design and later on, the Royal College of Art, under architect Ron Arad.
"The FBI Medal of Valor is presented in recognition of an exceptional act of heroism or voluntary risk of personal safety and life, and this act must have occurred in the direct line of duty or within the scope of FBI employment and in the face of criminal adversaries."
Afroditi Krassa was born in London, England.
Special Agent Robert Merta was grazed by a bullet when he tackled a fugitive prison escapee who had drawn his gun on Merta and three other agents when they tried to arrest him.
She was raised near Mount Olympus in Greece.
Merta received the Medal of Valor for risking his life to protect his fellow agents.
At the age of 17, she returned to her birthplace to become a designer.
"The FBI Memorial Star is presented to a surviving relative where death has occurred in the line of duty as the direct result of an adversarial action."
She has worked at some of the world’s largest consultancies and was the first ever female designer to be employed by the design duo Seymour Powell.
The family of Special Agent Paul M. Sorce, who died as a result of an auto accident in the line of duty, was given a Memorial Star.
In 2002, Krassa decided to go it alone and founded Afroditikrassa Ltd.
First publicized in the 1990s, it has not been used enough to have gained a fully established profile.
The young designer’s work was picked up by major brands such as Cassina, DKNY and design aficionados, such as Mourad Mazouz (Momo) of sketch.
RTI-51 can be expected to have properties lying somewhere in between RTI-31 and RTI-55.
In 2004 Krassa was commissioned by the entrepreneur Julian Metcalfe to design the interior and branding of sushi restaurant chain Itsu.
Importantly it has a ratio of monoamine reuptake inhibition of D > S > N (1.8:10.6:37.4nM respectively) which is an unusual balance of effects not produced by other commonly used compounds (although RTI-121 is similar, but more DAT selective).
The pioneering low fat food store rapidly grew into a chain of 19 stores in London and New York City.
It has been used in its Br radiolabelled form to map the distribution of dopamine transporters in the brain.
She was then appointed Creative Director in 2005.
Modern research seems to confirm the above hypothesis.
Offers for the design of restaurant, office and retail establishments around the world followed soon after, as well as collaborations with various manufacturers, such as lighting for Ligne Roset and Innermost, furniture for E&Y, packaging for Pret A Manger and WMF, and products for British American Tobacco and Phillip Morris.
However, earlier work produced more scattered results.
When not designing, she teaches, writes about and judges design.
Based upon what is obvious from the table, RTI-31, RTI-51, and RTI-55 are all similarly potent TRIs.
Her work has appeared in art and design publications worldwide and has been televised by the BBC, Channel 4, CNN and NTV.
More recent work has advocated using cloned human transporter/s.
Krassa's work ranges from political campaigns to car interiors and is always characterised by intellectual rigour and formal directness.
Between 1982–1994, American radio and media personality Howard Stern hosted a number of pay-per-view specials and released various VHS and audio tapes.
Helena Dvořáková or Helena Dvořák (born 30 January 1979) is a Czech actress.
Howard Stern's U.S. Open Sores was an event that occurred at the Nassau Coliseum, Uniondale, New York in front of a sold-out attendance of 16,000.
She was born in Brno, Czechoslovakia.
Taking place on October 7, 1989, the main event featured a tennis match between Howard Stern and his radio show producer Gary Dell'Abate.
She studied at an academic gymnasium and later continued her studies of dramatic arts at the Janáček Academy of Musical Arts (JAMU) in Brno.
The event sold out in four hours, with each ticket costing $22.50.
She graduated from JAMU in 2002.
Other suggested event titles included "The Bush Open", "U.S. Open Legs", "U.S. Open Beaver" and "U.S. Beaver Open".
Following her studies, she spent five seasons at the stage of the City Theatre in Brno.
The event was later released on VHS via mail order.
She is a member of the ensemble of Prague's Theatre in Dlouhá.
A documentary crew shot behind-the-scenes footage including interviews with participants and guests creating a 105-minute program.
Helena plays flute and singing in the choir and with folk band.
Butt Bongo Fiesta is a VHS of a special hosted by Howard Stern.
The Eyre River is a river in the Canterbury region of New Zealand.
Released in late 1992, the tape features "Jungle Man," a segment filmed for 3-D viewing, with each original tape being supplied with two 3-D viewing glasses.
It arises in the Puketeraki Range and flows south-east into the Waimakariri River near Christchurch International Airport.
The Miss Howard Stern New Year's Eve Pageant (later released as Howard Stern's New Year's Rotten Eve 1994; a send off to "Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve") was a two-hour pay-per-view special that aired on New Year's Eve 1993 and New Year's Day 1994, hosted by Howard Stern.
The connection with the Waimakariri is via a diversion channel running south-west, replacing the Eyre's original easterly flow.
Included in the special were parodies of Michael Jackson and Jerry Seinfeld, a song by Gary Dell'Abate (Stern's radio show Executive Producer) called "Doing the Baba Booey," and a mock beauty pageant resulting in the crowning of the show's first "Miss Howard Stern."
The river is named after Edward John Eyre, the Lieutenant-Governor of New Munster from 1848–53.
Judges for the pageant included Janis Ian, Daniel Carver, John Bobbitt, Sherman Hemsley, Mark Hamill, Tiny Tim and Joe Frazier.
The river rarely carries surface water, due to the unreliability of the easterly rains which feed it.
More than 40 women (and one man) participated in the pageant, most of whom were winners from preliminary contests held in cities where the radio show was being syndicated at the time.
Silver Blaze is a 1937 British, black-and-white crime and mystery film, based loosely on Arthur Conan Doyle's short story "The Adventure of Silver Blaze".
The field, which was narrowed down to 20, competed in the lingerie and talent rounds.
It was directed by Thomas Bentley, and was produced by Twickenham Film Studios Productions.
Five finalists were announced and after an interview round, the runners-up and winner were announced.
It stars Arthur Wontner as Sherlock Holmes, and Ian Fleming as Dr. Watson.
During the pageant, there were many sentiments made among the contestants about favoritism given to certain girls, notably Debbie Tay, because they were hand-picked by Stern on his radio show, therefore given more attention and exposure.
In the United States the film was released in 1941 by Astor Pictures, where it was also known as Murder at the Baskervilles, retitled by distributors to capitalize on the success of the Basil Rathbone Holmes film, "The Hound of the Baskervilles".
The special was available for order on VHS videotape, and came packaged with a limited edition Leroy Neiman lithograph of Howard.
In the 1930s, Sherlock Holmes takes a holiday by visiting his old friend, Sir Henry Baskerville (Lawrence Grossmith).
Released on February 25, 1997, the 29-track album features two that Stern himself provides lyrics, performing with Rob Zombie and The Dust Brothers.
Holmes' vacation ends when he and Watson suddenly find themselves in the middle of a double-murder mystery; they must find Professor Robert Moriarty (Lyn Harding) and Silver Blaze before the horse race, and bring the criminals to justice.
In 1997, the album was certified platinum for shipping 1,000,000 copies.
Peter Schmidl (born January 10, 1942) is an Austrian clarinetist.
When this year’s round of unsuspecting Northerners fail to show up for their annual Guts N’ Glory Jubilee because the Feds are investigating the disappearances of Northerners over the years, the residents of Pleasant Valley take their twisted carnival on the road and head to Iowa, where they encounter spoiled heiresses, Rome and Tina Sheraton, and the cast and crew of their “Road Rascals” reality show.
Schmidl was born in Olomouc, Czech Republic, and studied clarinet at the University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna.
They begin killing the cast and crew.
He was the principal clarinetist of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.

He has played with the MDR Orchestra, the Salzburg Mozarteum Orchestra, and the Tokyo New Philharmonia.
Unlike the first film Raw Nerve was not involved with the production.
He has taught at the University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna since 1967.
On October 21, 2009 "2001 Maniacs: The Beverly Hellbillys" was retitled to "2001 Maniacs: Field of Screams" announced Tim Sullivan in Santa Monica, California a short time before to movie start on American Film Market.
Sheikh Abdul Aziz (1952 – 11 August 2008) was chairman of the Jammu Kashmir Peoples League and a prominent member of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference, an alliance of Kashmiri separatist groups at the forefront of the political struggle against democratic Indian government in Jammu and Kashmir.
The finished film was unveiled at 2010's FRIGHT FEST in Glasgow, Scotland on February 26 and three other film festivals in the UK.
He was a strong advocate of the right to self-determination of Kashmiri people and believed that an independent plebiscite under UN supervision could bring long lasting peace in South-Asia.
The DVD release in the United Kingdom is set with the July 5, 2010.
Aziz was allegedly killed by Indian Paramilitary Forces on 11 August 2008 while leading a violent demonstration against the ‘alleged economic blockade’ of the Kashmir Valley predominantly having Muslim population being enforced by native Kashmiri hardliner groups during the Amarnath land transfer row .
The domestic Blu-ray release, with the unrated version is set for the July 20, 2010.
Aziz was a former militant commander turned "pro-freedom" politician.
The film had his US premiere on April 29, 2010 as part of the Texas Frightmare Weekend and is acquired by First Look Studios.
He had been jailed on several occasions for demanding accession of Kashmir with Pakistan.
The West Coast release is set for the July 17, 2010.
He is the third prominent separatist leader to have been killed after the eruption of 1989 Pakistan sponsored armed struggle against Indian government in Jammu and Kashmir
The New Jersey release on July 17, 2010 was hosted by Tim Sullivan.
With his death, Aziz emerged as new ‘martyr’ of Kashmiri Right to Self-Determination in league with Maqbool Bhat and caused a serious blow to the Kashmir conflict.
Scott Weinberg of Fearnet called it "a merciless chore to get through."
Sheikh Abdul Aziz was born in 1952 in Namblabal, district Pampore close to the capital city Srinagar.
R. L. Shaffer of IGN rated it 3/10 stars and called it derivative and dull.
He was of Arab ancestry whose ancestors had migrated from outside to Kashmir.
David Harley of Bloody Disgusting rated it 0.5/5 stars and described it as "a film which makes absolutely no sense, has no real plot, and is peppered with jokes that seem to be going for being merely crude and offensive rather than funny."
He received basic education from Government School Pampore and then passed Matriculation from Government High School Pampore.
It was described by Schrank in 1802.
Soon after passing his Matriculation examination, Aziz joined the agriculture business of his father Sheikh Abdul Salam, including growing high yield saffron, for which his hometown is famous throughout the Kashmir valley.
It is mainly found in Northern and parts of Central Europe and in isolated populations in Southern and South-Eastern Europe.
On 11 August 2008 the "Muzaffarabad chalo" call was given by the Hurriyat Conference and some other organisations against the 'economical blockade' of Kashmir valley.
In the North its range extends to the polar regions and in the South it is found up to the Alps.
Processions were taken out from various areas across the valley.
Its Eastern range extends through Central and North Russia up to the Ural, through Siberia up to the Yenisei River.
Aziz and Shabbir Shah were leading the march from Sopore towards the de facto border with Pakistan, when their rally was stopped by a force of police and army at Chala, 25 km away from the border town of Uri, to disperse the march.
The moth flies from May to July in the warmer regions and from June to August in Northern Europe.
Aziz along with many others were injured.
The larva preferably feeds on "Vaccinium myrtillus", "Vaccinium uliginosum", "Calluna vulgaris", "Lathyrus niger", "Salix repens" and "Erica".
All the critically injured were taken to Srinagar's SMHS hospital, where Aziz died.
Less frequent, they have also been recorded on "Lonicera tatarica", "Stellaria", "Polygonum aviculare", "Fragaria vesca", "Lactuca sativa" and "Taraxacum officinale".
He was buried in "Marty's Graveyard" in Eidgah, Srinagar on 12 August 2008.
Archer is an American adult animated sitcom created by Adam Reed for the basic cable network FX.
Anurag Kashyap (born November 23, 1991) was the winner of the 2005 Scripps National Spelling Bee, representing the "San Diego Union Tribune".
It follows the exploits of a dysfunctional group of secret agents—Sterling Archer (voiced by H. Jon Benjamin) and seven of his colleagues—Malory Archer (Jessica Walter), Lana Kane (Aisha Tyler), Cheryl Tunt (Judy Greer), Pam Poovey (Amber Nash), Ray Gillette (Adam Reed), Cyril Figgis (Chris Parnell) and Dr. Algernop Krieger (Lucky Yates).
He also won the "Jeopardy!" Teen Tournament in 2008.
The premise of "Archer" evolves in subsequent seasons as the show experiments with the standard setup of an anthology, each with self-contained arcs, new settings, a disparate set of personae for each character, even distinct humor.
Kashyap was born in Muzaffarpur, India and raised in Poway, California.
Beginning with the eighth season in 2017, the series moved to the FXX network.
He entered his first spelling bee for Poway Unified School District when he was in fourth grade at Valley Elementary School, and continued competing as a student at Meadowbrook Middle School.
"Archer" was conceived by Reed shortly after the cancellation of his Adult Swim comedy "Frisky Dingo".
In 2004, he placed 47th in the national spelling bee.
It draws inspiration from a variety of sources, including the "James Bond" franchise.
In the 19th round of the 2005 Scripps National Spelling Bee, 13-year-old eighth-grader Kashyap successfully spelled the word appoggiatura, which is defined as "a note of embellishment preceding another note and taking a portion of its time."
The show's hallmarks include reference-heavy humor, rapid-fire dialogue, and meta-comedy.
He won about $28,000.
"Archer" is produced using limited animation and takes its visual style from mid-century comic art.
in cash and prizes, which he saved most of it towards college.
The cast members record their lines individually, and the show regularly employs guest actors and actresses for supporting characters.
In 2008, Kashyap competed in the 25th season of the "Jeopardy!" Teen Tournament.
There have been 101 episodes broadcast in the show's history.
At the end of the ten-day tournament, Kashyap defeated Bradley Silverman from Georgia and Audrey Hosford from Maryland to become only the second student to win the Scripps National Spelling Bee and the Teen Tournament (The first was 1992 spelling bee and 1996 Teen Tournament champion Amanda Goad).
"Archer" has received positive reviews from critics and won awards, including three Primetime Emmy Awards and four Critics Choice Awards.
Kashyap graduated from Rancho Bernardo High School in San Diego, California in 2010, and had also studied at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, first as a summer intern with Inder Verma doing stem cell research in 2008.
The series has also received 15 Annie Award nominations, among others, for outstanding achievement in animation, writing, direction, and voice acting.
He enrolled at MIT with intentions to study biological sciences, graduated with a Bachelor's in 2015, and got his Master of Engineering in 2016.
At San Diego Comic-Con 2018, it was announced the tenth season will be titled "Archer: 1999".
Reiche was born in Potsdam.
Reed intends to leave "Archer" after its tenth season, although plans have not yet been finalized for the show's future.
After his Abitur in 1979, he studied Theology in Berlin.
"Archer" follows the exploits of eight dysfunctional secret agents of the International Secret Intelligence Service (ISIS), a fictional New York-based intelligence agency.
He took a break from studying in 1982/1983 to do an apprenticeship as cabinetmaker.
They are Sterling Archer, the show's narcissistic, womanizing protagonist; Malory Archer, the retired agent-turned-ISIS director and Sterling's snarky, emotionally distant mother; Lana Kane, Sterling's love interest and mother of his infant daughter, and by far the most professional field agent at ISIS; Ray Gillette, the agency's openly gay bomb specialist; Pam Poovey, the head of the agency's Human Resources department who is often ridiculed by her peers; Cyril Figgis, a mild-mannered accountant-turned-agent; Cheryl Tunt, Malory's delusional, psychotic personal assistant; and Dr. Algernop Krieger, a bizarre, morally bankrupt scientist with little regard for the well-being of his subjects.
In 1986 he completed his study and was from 1988 to 1990 pastor in Christinendorf.
The show features an array of supporting characters, several of whom gained expanded roles in subsequent episodes.
Reiche is married and has three daughters.
Major supporting roles in "Archer" include Slater, an arms dealer and agent for the CIA; Katya Kazanova, head of the KGB and Sterling's former love interest; and Barry Dylan, Sterling's archnemesis, who vows to kill him.
Reiche co-founded the Social Democratic Party of East Germany (SDP) in 1989, during the political process of the change ("Wende") 1989/90 that led to German Reunification.
This, according to art director Neal Holman, allowed producers the freedom to "cherry pick the stuff [they] like and ignore the elements that [they] don't."
He was member of the party executive committee.
Yet in "Archer" subsequent years, Reed developed new settings and character arcs, often with self-contained stories, as he explored new concepts for the comedy, much like an anthology.
Also he was member of the first free voted People's Chamber of East Germany, from March 1990 until the German Reunification at Octobre 3, 1990.
These seasons see the group attempt to complete a number of laborious tasks in highly unusual circumstances, generally to no avail, that involve sustaining an illegal cocaine operation to keep afloat, contract work for the CIA, and running a private, Los Angeles-based detective agency after being blacklisted from espionage by the US government.
After the merger of the SDP with the West German SPD, Reiche until 2000 was chairman of the SPD in Brandenburg.
The show's eighth season, "Archer Dreamland", transpires in Sterling's subconscious, re-imagining the core cast as stock characters from a Gangland-era noir film set in 1947 Los Angeles.
From 1990 until his resignation in 2005 he was member of the Landtag of Brandenburg.
The ninth season, "", continues this arc as the characters are again re-envisioned as inhabitants of a remote South Pacific island circa 1939.
In this time he was from 1994 to 1999 Ministry of Science, Research and Culture and from 1999 to 2004 Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport.
The tenth season will be set in Archer's subconscious version of space.
From 2005 to 2009, Reiche was a member of the German parliament, the Bundestag, representing Cottbus – Spree-Neiße.
According to Reed, it will be a "1970s vision of the future" with nods to the "prevalent aesthetic at the time", featuring "floppy disks instead of holograms", and "xenomorphs" of some description.
He also served as a member of the Parliamentary group board of the SPD.
The cable television network Comedy Central has exclusive US broadcast syndication rights for "Archer".
Kinsale RFC is a rugby union team located in the town of Kinsale, Co.
The terms of the deal cover the show's existing content and a commitment for future seasons.
Cork, Ireland - approximately 18 miles from Cork City.
Comedy Central began airing the series on their network on March 2, 2015, in one-hour program time slots.
Founded in 1982, the club's 1st team competes in Division 2 of the Munster Junior League.
In the United Kingdom, Viceland owns exclusive cable syndication rights for "Archer"s first five seasons.
Kinsale also fields various other teams including Ladies, Veterans, and have underage teams from U-8 up to U-18.
In Canada, the show is syndicated nationally on Teletoon at Night, and new episodes are aired in tandem with the American broadcast.
Kinsale RFC is also home to Europe's largest Rugby Sevens event, The Heineken Kinsale Sevens, which is held at its Snugmore grounds every May.
In 2014, Amazon Prime and Hulu purchased online streaming rights to "Archer" as part of multiyear licensing agreements with 20th Television.
Kinsale RFC is also the pround hosts of the annual Kinsale Sevens rugby tournament (also known as Heineken Kinsale Sevens, Kinsale Sevens By The Sea) - Ireland and Europe's premier seven-a-side club rugby event.
Beginning in 2018, Hulu retains exclusive streaming rights to the show under a new licensing agreement with 20th Century Fox.
The event takes place across the May Bank Holiday Weekend and witnesses teams from around the world compete against each other in ladies, men's (junior and senior) and veteran competitions.
Before the creation of "Archer", Adam Reed worked on animated comedies with executive producer and longtime collaborator Matt Thompson.
Dennis Dutko (1943–1990) was a member of the Michigan House of Representatives from 1974-1989.
The pair became renowned for their work on a number of Adult Swim television projects, chiefly "Sealab 2021" and their follow-up "Frisky Dingo", which aired for several years.
He was arrested on drunk driving charges four times while in office, the first time was in 1979.
After the cancellation of "Frisky Dingo" in 2008, Reed took a vacation to Spain to brainstorm ideas for a new project.
In 1989, he was sent to jail for seven months and resigned from the state House.
His experience traversing the Vía de la Plata, and people watching in Plaza Mayor in nearby Salamanca, enabled him to conceptualize his vision of "Archer".
In January 1990, he was arrested in Tennessee on charges of drug possession and driving without a licence.
Reed recalled in an interview, "So I sat on the Plaza Mayor for three days—drinking either coffee or beer or gin, depending on the time of day—surrounded by these Spanish women who seemed both unaware and completely aware of their beauty.
He committed suicide five days later at a Florida condominium.
And for three days, I couldn't even splutter "Buenos dias" to any of them—not once.
Elijah Smith (1860 – circa 1935) was an English footballer who played for in the Football League for Stoke.
And thus was Sterling Archer born—he would've absolutely sauntered over to a table full of those women and sat down and ordered an entire case of cava or whatever."
Smith played for local side Tunstall before joining Stoke in 1883.
Nevertheless, he believed developing a sitcom with the theme of global espionage was inevitable given his proclivity for adventure-driven comedy.
Smith combined being a footballer with his work as a vicar at the local church because of this he was known as 'Father Smith' to his Stoke teammates.
The "James Bond" franchise, "" (2006), and "The Pink Panther" franchise were Reed's inspiration as the series, then under the working title "Duchess", began taking definite form.
He played in the club's first competitive match in the FA Cup against Manchester in a 2–1 defeat.
By August 18, 2009, following Reed's pitch to FX, the network commissioned six episodes for "Archer".
Smith was a member of Stoke team which competed in the first season of the Football League.
FX initially commissioned the project as a companion series for their situational comedy "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia", but the network ultimately delayed "Archer" premiere to the following January because of the demanding production schedule, and "The League" became "Philadelphia" companion show instead.
He made his league debut on 8 September 1888, at wing-half for Stoke in a 2–0 defeat by West Bromwich Albion at the Victoria Ground.
Despite this, the pilot, "Mole Hunt", aired as a test screening on September 17, 2009, following the season five premiere of "Philadelphia".
Smith made 21 League appearances (out of 22) in the 1888–89 season as Stoke finished bottom of the table.
The pilot was not featured in program listings or otherwise promoted by FX; rather the network merely informed select television critics of the broadcast.
He played a further four matches for Stoke before leaving in 1890 and he joined Wolverhampton based Stafford Road.
FX moved "Archer" to FXX's broadcast lineup in 2017 as part of an aggressive strategy to increase the network's output of animated programming.
Charles Jonas Thornton (May 30, 1850 – July 2, 1932) was a political figure in Durham, Ontario.
FX had planned the move before the show's seventh season, in conjunction with the debut of "Cassius and Clay", but decided against it after "Clay" abrupt cancellation.
He was born in Clarke Township, Ontario and was a farmer.
The ninth season premiered on April 25, 2018.
He was elected to the township council and served on the body for seven years.
Reed intends to conclude "Archer" after its tenth season, although plans have not yet been finalized according to a 2018 interview with IndieWire.
He also served on Durham West county council for five years.
Scriptwriting an episode consumes three weeks of the production schedule.
Thornton first ran for the House of Commons of Canada as a Patrons of Industry candidate in Durham West during the 1896 federal election but fared poorly comining in third place with less than 500 votes.
As the comedy's main writer, Reed typically creates the first draft during pre-production, which he submits to his team of producers and art directors.
He was elected as the Conservative MP for Durham West in the 1900 federal election.
From there, they analyze the script for each character, cast guest stars, and create basic concept designs, before Reed develops a final script to submit to FXX.
His election was declared void in October 1901 and his seat declared vacant.
A typical "Archer" episode goes through a page of dialogue per minute.
A by-election was held in January 1902 in which his Liberal opponent defeated Thornton by 28 votes.
"Archer" uses the standard setup of a workplace comedy, where "subversively unlikeable" characters play off bawdy, reference-heavy humor, rapid-fire dialogue, and interaction-based drama.
He returned to the House of Commons in the 1908 federal election, this time representing Durham, and was re-elected in the 1911 federal election.
By the end of the fourth season, however, Reed questioned the longevity of the comedy's spy premise and began contemplating a new direction for "Archer", partly inspired by the then-growing associations of ISIS with the identically initialled fundamentalist Salafi jihadist group.
Thornton remained in parliament until the 1917 federal election in which he stepped aside so that the wartime Union Government which Conservative Prime Minister Sir Robert Borden had formed could run Liberal-Unionist Newton Wesley Rowell as a pro-Government candidate.
Newer seasons experiment with the standard format of an anthology, each with their own self-contained arc, new settings, a disparate set of personae for each character, even distinct humor.
Thornton was a member of the Orange Order.
Reed said, "Once we started making them, and having a good time making them, [we thought] 'what are some other things we can do now that the boundaries have sort of been passed?'"
He died in Orono, Ontario in 1932.
Cultural references on "Archer" cover a wide spectrum of society and the human condition, in film, literature and music for example.
The Trade Union Congress is a general trade union in Jamaica.
Some—chiefly references to literature—are obscure, and the audience often may not notice them in a single viewing.
Initially organised as a trade union council to be the labour wing of the People's National Party (PNP) in 1943, the organisation split in 1952 with the formation of the National Workers Union (which maintained alignment with the PNP).
Reed cites his time as a university English major as the primary forebear for the show's literary references.
The TUC was a founding member of the Jamaica Confederation of Trade Unions.
"Archer" also develops a unique self-referentiality through character-based jokes, catchphrases, and running gags that evolve over multiple episodes.
The Trade Union Congress came into existence as a result of shifts in politics in Jamaica in the 1940s and early 1950s.
For example, Sterling or another character may yell "phrasing" in response to any sexually suggestive remark.
In 1943 differences between the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union (BITU) and People's National Party (PNP) led to the formation of the "Trade Union Council" which grouped 16 small unions together in alignment to the PNP, in contrast to BITU which was responsible for the foundation of the Jamaica Labour Party in that year.
Neil Genzlinger of "The New York Times" argues that "Archer" uses "a caustic brand of humor that isn't for everybody but that has brought the show a dedicated fan base."
In 1946 the TUC was reorganised as the "Trade Union Congress" and in 1948 14 of the member unions were merged into a single union under the same name, with two unions remaining separate but affiliated.
Line work is pronounced by thick, bold outlines, in contrast to the very fine, thin line work characteristic of prime time comedies such as "The Simpsons" and "Family Guy".
Rapid learning (or Rapid eLearning Development) has traditionally referred to a methodology to build e-learning courses rapidly.
Production of the comedy involves a workforce of 150 crew members from Reed and Thompson's Atlanta-based company Floyd County Productions, quadrupling the number that worked on its freshman season.
Typically the author will create slides in PowerPoint, record narration on top of the slides, and then use software to add tests, or even collaboration activities between the slides.
"Archer"s production process uses Adobe software—Photoshop, Illustrator, and After Effects—as well as visual effects programs such as Toon Boom Harmony and Cinema 4D for compositing and animation.
The whole package is then sent, most often as an Adobe Flash file, to a learning management system or website.
This begins via storyboarding, typically after a script has been approved, and lasts around 11–13 weeks per episode.
E-learning has grown rapidly since the 1990s but developers and organizations were confronted by the complexity of authoring processes.
Four episodes are produced in tandem at any given session, generally in staggered phases.
The difficulty and expense of building online courses from scratch led to the idea of recycling existing resources like Powerpoint presentations, and transforming them into e-learning courses.
In the initial stages of animation, art director Chad Hurd and producer Neal Holman storyboard set pieces with a team of artists based on specifications in the script.
A traditional e-learning development project can take several months.
After a series of design revisions and reviews, these skeletal designs are then rendered as 3D models in Autodesk 3ds Max, employing a variety of animation and special effects techniques.
In contrast the aim of rapid e-learning is to build and roll out content modules within weeks.
The illustration team takes various screenshots of the 3D models once they have been completed, and the resulting images are enhanced by specialized artists in After Effects.
For example, while one hour of standard e-learning can take 73 to 220 hours to develop, a PowerPoint to e-learning conversion can be estimated to take an average of 33 hours to develop.
The characters are composed in Illustrator using referential material, among them photos of models and actors in costume.
The term "rapid learning" is also sometimes used as a synonym for "short-form" or "bite-size" learning.
Because "Archer" is produced using limited animation, characters are rendered as digital puppets, and not hand-drawn on paper and digitally composited for traditional cel animation.
In this usage, it refers not to how rapidly a module can be created by an e-learning developer, but how rapidly it can be viewed by a learner.
Costumes may or may not be reproduced depending on their animatability; too much detail can hurt a character's animatability.
Several rapid learning software applications with varying capabilities are on the market.
These body pieces are then separated into basic components and layers, much like an action figure, and rigged in After Effects.
Most of them are authoring tools that include rapid learning as a feature.
Consequently, one given pose can turn into a range of others, which, according to producer Bryan Fordney, creates "the illusion of more animation on screen than what is actually present."
Some of these tools treat each slide as a learning object and allow to add tests and online activities between the slides.
A similar technique is used in the animation of a character's face—head illustrations are divided into basic components that can be turned "off" and "on" in sequence, lending the appearance of facial movement and expression.
Some of these software are online services, the others are desktop applications to install on your computer.
Source code is often implemented to ensure better automation and a more fluid range of motion.
A trend of the market is also to combine rapid learning (conversion of PowerPoint presentations) with screencast (filming your screen and your mouse movements) so as to provide both a sequence of slides and applications demos.
Once compositing begins, compositors enhance the visual palette of artwork from three or four departments until it "looks like it was made by a single artist."
This combination is particularly powerful when authoring courses on how to use a software.
For elaborate scenes like action sequences, artists develop several composites, which are then superimposed on stock footage using special effects.
After 2000, a series of rapid learning tools were proposed on the market and became popular because of their simplicity and the feeling that anyone could build an e-learning course from a simple PowerPoint presentation.
Holman cited "Catch Me If You Can" (2002), "The Incredibles" (2004), "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" (2006), and the work of Saul Bass as strong stylistic influences in the creation of "Archer" title sequence.
Some experts have highlighted the limits of this method or even insisted on the fact that rapid learning was the consequence of the misapprehension that if a face-to-face course worked well with PowerPoint, it would function equally well online.
When he was developing the original sequence, the rough draft version consisted of style frames with roiling flame silhouettes of the characters coalesced on a charred, black background.
This criticism of rapid learning development focuses on the idea that the richness of an interaction with students in the classroom is not encapsulated in a PowerPoint presentation file.
The crew initially struggled to develop an opening theme they believed was compatible with the premise of "Archer", but once the show's eponymous theme song had been completed, Holman felt his idea was too melodramatic and went in a different direction.
Consequently, an online course is a mere passive information presentation but not a training activity with questions, workshops, problems.
He created the finalized version of the sequence from several segments, each reviewed by the producers, because of the demanding production schedule.
Rapid learning has been criticized for ignoring the axiom that people "learn by doing".
The standard opening of "Archer" has gone through six iterations—a replacement of shots at the start of the show's sixth season, and brand new sequences for its fifth, seventh, eighth and ninth seasons.
More globally, the critics of rapid learning have followed the same track as the critics on the use of PowerPoint in education.
"Archer" did not employ a composer to develop a soundtrack in its first four seasons, but instead used a compilation of needle drop stock music.
The success of rapid learning has an economic reason.
By season five, musician JG Thirlwell was hired as the composer for the comedy's jazz-influenced score, brought to the producers' attention for his work on "The Venture Bros.".
Many developers and organizations are able for the first time to build their online course without the help of an e-learning team (including instructional designers, art designers and other contributors).
Benjamin voices the show's titular character, Walter voices Malory Archer, Tyler plays Lana Kane, Greer portrays Cheryl Tunt, Nash plays Pam Poovey, Parnell voices Cyril Figgis, Yates portrays Dr. Algernop Krieger, and Reed plays Ray Gillette.
The overall evolution of internet practice and the development of the Web 2.0 collaboration scenarios might lead trainers to other scenarios.
Reed was expected to play the titular role in the original pilot, but was recast because producers felt his voice-over did not serve the character's dialogue well.
Rapid learning is seen an inheritance of the CD-ROM model and the idea that e-learning consists in an individual self-paced practice.
When Benjamin received the offer, he was surprised since he did not believe his voice was suitable for the part.
Students often complain that self-paced individual learning can be unengaging and offers little chances of interaction, correction and success.
At one point, Benjamin used a British accent for the character, but Reed insisted he use his normal speaking voice.
This can be overcome through scenarios where the information is presented as rapid learning modules encapsulated in Flash SCORM packages or distributed on Learning Management Systems, and the learning activities developed through other tools, such as blogs, wikis, forums or videoconferences.
Producers contracted her shortly after they sent out character descriptions to talent agencies, and they promoted her involvement to recruit actors for the project.
Lois Ewell (January 28, 1885 - ?)
Greer agreed to "Archer" because of her wish to break into voice acting, although she initially believed the series was too provocative for network TV.
, was an American soprano opera singer and Broadway theatre performer.
Nash did not audition for her part, rather the actress was approached by Reed and Thompson, whom she had previously collaborated with in "Frisky Dingo", while she was recording DVD extras for their program.
She was born on January 28, 1885 in Memphis, Tennessee to James Levi Ewell.
Yates was brought onto "Archer" at Nash's request, after Krieger was given a more prominent speaking role.
She married Henry Ramond Tredwell of Port Washington, New York in 1905 in Brooklyn, New York.
In addition to the main cast, episodes often feature guest voices from a range of professions.
In 1908, she appeared in The Merry Widow at the New Amsterdam Theatre in New York City.
Major supporting roles in "Archer" are played by George Coe (until his death in 2015), Jeffrey Tambor, Christian Slater, Jon Hamm, Allison Tolman, Dave Willis, Ona Grauer, Keegan-Michael Key, Bryan Cranston, and J.K. Simmons, among others.
She divorced in Chicago in 1909.
Some stars appear as themselves, or portray fictionalized caricatures of themselves, such as Slater, Kenny Loggins, as well as the late Anthony Bourdain and Burt Reynolds.
In 1913 she appeared in the Century Opera Company's production of Aida in Manhattan.
"Archer" cast members record their lines individually rather than at group recording sessions to accommodate their work schedules.
The Longsight International Festival (LIF) was an international cultural festival which celebrated the best of the Longsight area of Manchester.
The producers therefore do not host table reads or rehearsals.
The festival was organised by Life Plus an international NGO and it was supported by Manchester City Council.
Recording sessions can take place anywhere, but are typically held at studios in Atlanta, Los Angeles, and New York, depending on the actor's home base.
LIF was an annual event; the first edition happened in July 2008.
"Archer" has been well received by the media.
The 2nd Festival was due to take place on August 16, 2009.
A number of TV critics have complimented the work of the voice actors, often singling out Benjamin for further praise: Tim Goodman from "The Hollywood Reporter", for example, viewed Benjamin's acting as the bedrock of "Archer", "mixing rants, mumbling, whining and a stop-and-start delivery style that is note-perfect for comedy."
The LIF 2008 Festival took place in July 2008 at Longsight Library.
Other reviewers cited the writing, the crude sensibility, and characterization among the show's most satisfying attributes: the main characters have been described as "exceedingly well-defined."
The 2009 edition of the festival was due to take place on Sunday, August 16, at Longsight Market.
Chris Barton of the "Los Angeles Times" called "Archer" "the smartest, strangest animated show on TV this side of "Rick and Morty"," and "Entertainment Weekly" journalist Ken Tucker praised the series for its "solid plotting, vividly distinct characters, and some of the most unexpected punchlines and sight-gags in prime time."
Longsight's Got Talent was also to be staged for the very first time and aimed to showcase the best of local talent.
"Archer" willingness to experiment with anthologized tropes is a principal topic of discussion among critics.
iFixit is a private company in San Luis Obispo, California.
Some journalists felt these arcs provide the show greater creative license to explore deeper within itself.
Founded in 2003 as a result of Kyle Wiens not finding an Apple iBook G3 repair manual while the founders were attending Cal Poly, the company sells repair parts and publishes free wiki-like online repair guides for consumer electronics and gadgets on its web site.
While the comedy received positive feedback for staying true to form "in the service of something much grimier and at once totally fresh" in early seasons, later "Archer" episodes have been subjected to criticism as the tone and emphasis of the show evolves.
The company also performs product teardowns of consumer devices.
By the eighth and ninth seasons, some critics believed that despite having greater visual appeal, "Archer" too often sacrifices narrative continuity and humor through increasingly predictable and uninspired writing.
iFixit has released product teardowns of new mobile and laptop devices, which provides advertising for the company's parts and equipment sales.
The series has been included on a number of best of lists.
These teardowns have been covered by "PC World" (now defunct), the "Mac Observer", "NetworkWorld" and other publications.
"TV Guide" ranked "Archer" among the 60 greatest TV cartoons of all time, and the show placed within the top ten on "Entertainment Weekly" 25 Greatest Animated TV Series.
Co-founder Kyle Wiens has said he aims to reduce electronic waste by teaching people to repair their own gear, and by offering tools, parts, and a forum to discuss repairs.
Similarly, "The New Yorker", in a non-ranked rundown of 2014's most noteworthy programs, called "Archer" "good counter-programming for every horrible thing in the news."
In 2011, he traveled through Africa with a documentary team.
"Archer" success allowed the ensemble to embark on a nationwide tour, "Archer Live!"
iFixit provides a software as a service platform known as Dozuki to allow others to use iFixit's documentation framework to produce their own documentation.
, where the actors performed scenes from the show's repertoire.
O'Reilly Media's "Make" and "Craft" magazines use Dozuki to feature community guides alongside instructions originally written by the staff for the print magazine.
The tour commenced with shows in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Philadelphia, and New York—sporadic dates were later added to the itinerary.
In September 2015, Apple removed the iFixit app from the App Store in reaction to the company's publication of a teardown of a developer pre-release version of the Apple TV (4th generation) obtained under Apple's Developer Program violating a signed Non-Disclosure Agreement and as such their developer account was suspended.
Live readings may also be held at promotional events such as the San Diego Comic-Con International.
In response iFixit says it has worked on improving its mobile site for users to access its services through a mobile browser.
FX released "Cherlene (Songs from the Series Archer)", a compilation of country music, on March 3, 2014, through digital media.
On April 3, 2014 iFixit announced a partnership with Fairphone
The album features a cover of "Danger Zone", with guest vocals by Kenny Loggins, as well as three original tracks composed by Aaron Lee Tasjan.
Gerek Lin Meinhardt (born July 27, 1990) is an American foil fencer.
Kevn Kinney, frontman of Drivin N Cryin, led music production of "Cherlene".
Meinhardt is one of two children born to Kurt and Jane Meinhardt.
Kinney had met Adam Reed a decade earlier, and was hired after a lunch meeting with the writer and Matt Thompson in Atlanta.
He attended Lick-Wilmerding High School in San Francisco for two years and completed high school in a home schooling program.
In preparation for his services, Kinney viewed "Archer" first three seasons to familiarize himself with Cheryl Tunt—the eponymous character of "Cherlene".
He attended the University of Notre Dame on a full fencing scholarship.
The album was recorded at Griffin Mastering, Inc. with a group that included Tasjan, David Franklin, and Drivin N Cryin member Dave V. Johnson on instrumentation.
He majored in business and finance, and was a member of the school's fencing team from 2009-2014.
Jessy Lynn Martens provided Cheryl's singing voice, chosen because of her subdued Southern accent and likeness to Judy Greer's voice.
Gerek is currently employed by Deloitte Advisory.
"Cherlene" received positive reviews and peaked at number 68 on iTunes' best-selling albums chart.
Introduced to the sport at age 9 through a program run by Olympic fencer Greg Massialas, Meinhardt began participating in national fencing competitions a year later.
In June 2016, Thompson and executive producer Casey Willis discussed the possibility of a feature-length "Archer" film with "The Daily Beast".
At age 16 he became the youngest men's national foil champion when he won the tournament at the 2007 U.S. Fencing National Championships.
According to Thompson, this discussion happens "once every two years" among Reed and the producers, although work on the project would likely not begin until after the show ends.
Ranked 16th in the world at the time, he participated in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing as a member of the United States fencing team.
As well, they cited Jon Hamm as their ideal choice of actor to portray Sterling if it's commissioned as a live-action adaptation.
He was the youngest fencer in Beijing and the youngest U.S. Olympic fencer of all time.
Karen Burke (born 14 July 1971) is an English footballer.
At the 2010 World Fencing Championships in Paris, he won a bronze medal in the men's foil event, tying with Yuki Ota of Japan.
She most recently played for Blackburn Rovers Ladies.
After his gold medal win at the 2012 U.S National Championships, he was selected as an alternate fencer for the 2012 London Olympics U.S men's foil team.
Burke was born in Liverpool and represented England at full international level.
Cyrille Merville (born 14 April 1982) is a French football goalkeeper.
Burke only took up football aged 21, with a spell at St. Helens.
Merville was born in Amiens, France.
In 1994 she reached her first FA Women's Cup final with Knowsley United.
He signed for then-Ligue 1 side AC Arles-Avignon in the summer of 2009 from Troyes AC.
Burke hit the crossbar in injury–time as Knowsley lost 1–0 to Doncaster Belles.
In June 2014, he signed a two-year contract with US Créteil-Lusitanos.
In the following year's final, with Knowsley now known as Liverpool Ladies, player–of–the–match Burke twice put them ahead against Arsenal, only for Marieanne Spacey to seal a 3–2 win for The Gunners.
The incentive payments are direct payments made under the National Wool Act (P.L. 83-690, Title VII) to producers of wool and mohair, which were similar to deficiency payments made to producers of grains and cotton.
In summer 1995 Burke agreed to join Everton Ladies, but changed her mind when Liverpool appointed John Bennison — a professional coach from the Liverpool F.C. "Boot Room".
The incentive payment rate was the percentage needed to bring the national average return to producers (the market price plus the incentive payment) up to the annually set national support price.
In April 1996 Burke lost her third consecutive FA Women's Cup final to Croydon, on penalties after a 1–1 draw at The New Den.
Each producer’s direct payment was the payment rate times the market receipts.
Luckless Burke had given Liverpool the lead and converted her penalty in the shoot–out.
Producers with higher market receipts got larger support payments.
She finally joined Everton Ladies in the 1997 close season and won the Premier League title in 1997–1998.
This created an incentive to increase output and to improve quality.
She played in Iceland in summer 1998, 1999 and 2000, with ÍBV.
The wool and mohair commodity programs ended after the 1995 marketing year as required by P.L. 103-130.
In 2000 Burke and team–mate Becky Easton joined Doncaster Belles.
The 2002 farm bill (P.L. 107-171, Sec. 1201) made wool and mohair eligible for marketing assistance loans and loan deficiency payments.
Burke would travel twice weekly to Doncaster from her base in Liverpool, where she worked in a pub.
For conservation programs, incentive payments refer to cost-sharing payments that producers may receive to attract participation.
The 2002 FA Women's Cup Final was Burke's fourth unsuccessful appearance, as Doncaster were beaten 2–1 by the full–time professionals of Fulham.
In some programs, the federal portion of these payments can vary; for these programs, the higher share is provided for the more desirable conservation practices that will provide greater benefits.
Burke moved to Leeds United Ladies for 2002–2003 before spending the 2003 close season back with Icelandic side ÍBV.
Brandon Hall is a Greek Revival architecture style house built in 1856 in Washington, Mississippi, United States.
She returned to Doncaster Belles for 2003–2004, before joining an exodus of players brought about by a cash–crisis and moving back to Leeds, via another stint at ÍBV.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.
Burke then suffered more FA Women's Cup final disappointment with Leeds United Ladies, in their 5–0 defeat against Arsenal in 2006.
Majestic Brandon Hall was formally a large working cotton plantation located on the scenic Natchez Trace.
Burke left Leeds to join Blackburn Rovers Ladies in the 2007 close season.
The land on which Brandon Hall now stands first passed into private ownership as a royal grant from the Spanish King Carlos III in 1788.
Although signed as an attacking midfielder, she moved to right–back for the 2009–10 season.
In 1809 the property was sold at public auction to William Lock Chew for the sum of $7,000.
Burke has won over 50 caps for the England senior team.
Chew constructed the first permanent dwelling consisting of a three-room brick house about twenty by sixty feet, built sometime between 1809 and 1820.
The Economic Intelligence Council is the apex forum overseeing government agencies responsible for economic intelligence and combating economic offences in India.
This structure still exists as the "basement" of the present house known as Brandon Hall.
The Economic Intelligence Council is responsible for coordination, strategy and information-sharing amongst the government agencies responsible for intelligence and control of economic offences such as smuggling, money laundering tax evasion and fraud.
In 1833 Chew sold the property to Nathaniel Hoggatt, a successful planter whose daughter Charlotte inherited the land after his death.
The Council also advises the Finance Minister and the Union Council of Ministers on laws regulating the financial sector and fighting economic crimes.
On October 29, 1840, Charlotte Hoggatt married Gerard Brandon III, who was the son of an early Governor of Mississippi and the grandson of a Revolutionary War Hero of the same name.
Its chief members include the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and the Directors of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence.
They lived in this original dwelling until 1853, when they began construction of Brandon Hall which was completed in 1856.
Members from the Finance Ministry include the Secretaries of Finance, Revenue, Company Affairs and the Additional Secretary of Banking.
In January 1914, the plantation, house, and land was sold to George Hightower as a result of a default on a promissory note, thus ending an 81-year chain of ownership by the Brandon and Hoggatt families.
The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs is represented by its chairman and its members responsible for the Excise/GST, Customs and Anti-Smuggling departments.
These 81 years extended from Mississippi's frontier days during the period of grace and plenty before the Civil War, and through the South's darkest hours after the war.
The Central Board of Direct Taxes is represented by its chairman and the member for investigation.
From 1914 until the present, Brandon Hall Plantation has had ten owners.
Other department heads include the Directors of the Directorate General of Economic Enforcement.
In 1987 the home was completely renovated and restored, perfectly duplicating the original construction.
The committees are constituted of a wide range of agencies and officials responsible for the designated regions.
In 2009 the owners of the house, Edward L. and James R. Diefenthal of New Orleans, Louisiana, donated the house to the Historic Natchez Foundation.
The Xiaohe (Little River) Cemetery , also known as Ördek’s Necropolis, refers to a bronze-age burial site located near the dried out Lop Nur Lake, in Xinjiang, Western China.
In December 2009 the home was purchased by Ron and Kathy Garber of Lafayette, Louisiana, who opened it for Bed and Breakfast accommodation.
It is an oblong sand dune, from which more than 30 well-preserved mummies, buried in air-tight ox-hide bags, have been excavated.
Michael Valentine MacKenzie(born 13 September 1983 in Windhoek) is a Namibian rugby union player.
The mummies, the earliest of which date from around 4000 years ago, appear Caucasoid.
He plays as a prop.
Genetic analysis, however, revealed an admixture of population from both the West and East, with paternal lineages being exclusively west Eurasian, and maternal lineages - a mixture of east and west Eurasian.
MacKenzie had 8 caps for Namibia national rugby union team, from 2004 to 2007, with 2 tries scored, 10 points in aggregate.
The entire Xiaohe Tomb complex contains about 330 tombs, about 160 of which have been looted by grave robbers.
He participated with the squad at the 2007 Rugby World Cup, playing in three games.
The Xiaohe remains contains the largest number of mummies found at any single site in the world to date.
He has been absent from the National Team since then.
No human settlement has been found near the tomb complex; the bodies were therefore likely to have been transported from elsewhere for burial at this site.
Fernando (or Hernando) Yáñez de la Almedina, born in Almedina, Spain in "c".
A local hunter named Ördek found the site around 1910.
1475 and died in Valencia, Kingdom of Spain in 1536, was a Spanish painter.
Later, in 1934, partly with Ördek's help, Swedish explorer and archeologist Folke Bergman located the site which he named Ördek’s Necropolis.
He was one of the most important early Renaissance painters in Spain.
The tomb complex appeared as a small oval mound, and the top of the burial mound was covered with a forest of erect wooden posts whose tops had been splintered by strong winds.
Of "morisco" origin, he travelled to Italy to study fine art, and in the process became familiar with the work of Leonardo da Vinci.
Oar-shaped wooden monuments and wooden human figures were found at the site.
After returning to Spain, he collaborated with Hernando de los Llanos on many works.
The coffins were assembled over the bodies which had become mummified.
Stefano Cipressi (born 25 November 1982 in Bologna) is an Italian slalom canoeist who has competed at the international level since 2000.
Bergman excavated 12 burials and recovered approximately 200 artifacts that were transported back to Stockholm.
He won a complete set of medals at the ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships with a gold (K1: 2006), a silver (K1 team: 2006), and a bronze (K1 team: 2010).
Bergman noted the surprising resemblance in the clothing, especially the fringed loin-cloths, to Bronze Age grave finds in Denmark, but dismissed any direct connection.
He also won two bronze medals at the European Championships.
In October 2003, an excavation project, organized by the Xinjiang Cultural Relics and Archaeology Institute, began at the site.
Cipressi switched to single canoe (C1) class later on in his career and finished 13th in this event at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.
A total of 167 tombs have been uncovered since the end of 2002, and excavations have revealed hundreds of smaller tombs built in layers.
Graphoderus austriacus is a species of beetle in family Dytiscidae.
In 2006, a coffin wrapped with ox hide in the shape of a boat was found.
"Graphoderus austriacus" can reach a length of about .
It contained a remarkably intact mummy of a young woman, which came to be called the Beauty of Xiaohe.
Body is broadly oval.
Each tomb is marked by a vertical poplar post near the upper end of the coffin.
There is a small transverse fascia on the pronotum.
A skull or horn of an ox may be suspended from the post.
This species is present in Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, mainland Denmark, mainland France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Kaliningrad, Latvia, Moldova, Poland, Russia (Central, East and South), Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine, and Yugoslavia.
The ends of the posts can be either torpedo-shaped or oar-shaped, representing the phallus and vulva respectively.
Waikiwi is a suburb of Invercargill, Southland, New Zealand.
The male burials were marked with the oar-shaped posts, while the female burials were marked with the phallic posts.
Invercargill is the southernmost city of New Zealand.
Bows and arrows were found with the male burials.
Waikiwi lies on the northern edge of Invercargill.
The posts and coffins may be painted red.
It is bounded on the west by the Ohai Industrial Line and on the south by the Waihopai River.
Each coffin is made of two massive pieces of plank assembled over the body, resembling an overturned boat, and then covered with cowhides.
There is farmland to the north and east, although the suburb is expanding to the north.
A few special tombs containing females have an extra rectangular coffin on top covered with layers of mud.
The southern third of Waikiwi is divided between Prestonville, a commercial / industrial area in the south-west, and Thomsons Bush, a reserve in the south-east.
Small masks of human faces and wooden human figures may accompany the burials.
Liz Feldman (born May 21, 1977) is an American comedian, actress, producer and writer.
Twigs and branches of ephedra were placed beside the body.
Feldman is a comedian, writer, actress and producer born and raised in Brooklyn, New York.
In years 2009–2015, the remains of in total 92 individuals found at the Xiaohe Tomb complex were analyzed for Y-DNA and mtDNA markers.
She is the creator and executive producer of the upcoming Netflix dark comedy series "Dead To Me," executive produced by Will Ferrell and Adam McKay.
Genetic analyses of the mummies showed that the maternal lineages of the Xiaohe people originated from both East Asia and West Eurasia, whereas the paternal lineages all originated from West Eurasia.
Feldman began her career as a stand up comic at the age of 16 and made her TV debut as a performer and writer for "All That" on Nickelodeon in 1995.
Mitochondrial DNA analysis, which reveals the maternal ancestry, showed that maternal lineages carried by the Xiaohe people included West Eurasian haplogroups H, K, U5, U7, U2e, T and R*; East Asian haplogroups B5, D and G2a; haplogroups of most likely Central Asian or Siberian origin C4 and C5; as well as typically South Asian haplogroups M5 and M*.
She is a graduate of Boston University and an alumnus of The Second City and The Groundlings.
On the other hand, nearly all (11 out of 12 - or around 92%) of surveyed paternal lines were of West Eurasian haplogroup R1a1, and one was of exceptionally rare basal paragroup K*.
She went on to write for "Blue Collar TV, Hot in Cleveland", "The 79th, 86th and 87th Academy Awards, 2 Broke Girls" and "The Ellen DeGeneres Show", for which she won four Emmy awards.
According to a comment posted on 18 July 2014 by Hui Zhou, one of study's co-authors, Xiaohe R1a1 lineages belonged to a specifically European branch rather than the more common Central Asian R-Z93.
She created the NBC sitcom "One Big Happy" starring Elisha Cuthbert, executive produced by Ellen DeGeneres.
Richard Hurlin (born 14 January 1984 in Cardiff) is a Welsh footballer, who plays for Peninsula Power Football Club.
Since 2008, Liz has been the host of "This Just Out", a YouTube talk show that celebrates lesbian culture.
He started his career with Cardiff City FC as a youth player but would later sign for his home town team Llanelli AFC in the summer of 2001.
The “gay positive” show is filmed at Liz’s kitchen table and features LGBTQ and LGBTQ-friendly actors, comedians, writers and musicians.
After impressing in his first season in the Welsh Premier League he signed for title chasers Cwmbran Town AFC in the 2003 January transfer window where he would spend the next three seasons.
Liz has been an outspoken advocate for LGBTQ rights.
During his time at Cwmbran, Richard attracted interest from a number of football league clubs and after an unsuccessful trial at Nottingham Forest F.C. he spent 3 months with Swansea City A.F.C. where he was on the verge of signing until Manager Nick Cusack was released from his coaching position and the deal fell through.
In 2008, her joke about same-sex marriage (“It’s very dear to me, the issue of gay marriage, or as I like to call it ‘marriage,’ you know, because I had lunch this afternoon, not gay lunch.
Richard would stay with Cwmbran until March 2005, during which time he enjoyed great success with the club, one which gave him the opportunity to play against Israel giants Maccabi Haifa in the UEFA cup 1st qualifying stage, losing 6-0 on aggregate.
I park my car, I didn’t gay park it.”)
His time at Cwmbran also saw him score the fastest ever goal for the club, after just 18 seconds he drove the ball past Caersws's goalkeeper from the edge of the box.
went viral, recreated thousands of times across various platforms in the campaign against Prop 8, which sought to outlaw same sex marriage.
This cementing him into Cwmbran's history books.
In 2012, Liz was named one of The Advocate’s “40 Under 40.”
In March 2005 Richard left Cwmbran Town to pursue a football career in the US where he was awarded a four-year soccer scholarship at Savannah College of Art and Design.
In 2016, Liz signed a multi-year overall deal with CBS Studios to develop new projects.
While at college in the US he achieved All Region, All Conference and All American honors in his first 3 seasons and broke two college records in doing so.
In 2013, Liz married musician Rachael Cantu.
On 12 March 2012 signed for Australian side Peninsula Power Football Club and played on 18 March his Debut against Capalaba Football Club in the Brisbane Premier League.
They live in Los Angeles, California.
During his time at Cwmbran, Richard also picked up a succession of international caps for the Welsh U19's team after impressing manager Neville Southall in an international friendly against Norway he was chosen to play in the Milk Cup against Paraguay, Northern Ireland and Scotland and would also serve his country in the European U19 championship playing against Hungary, Andorra and Ireland.
Lyon Hunter is a fictional character on the popular American daytime soap opera "As the World Turns", portrayed by Evan Alex Cole.
Neville Southall once described Richard as being 'the first ever £1million unattached player' whilst on international duty.
He made his debut on the show on Thursday, April 30, 2009.
The album was released on September 9, 2009.
Hunter first arrived in Oakdale after being promoted from the IT Department of Worldwide by Lucinda Walsh to become Emily Stewart's new co-editor at "The Intruder", when the decision was made to move the paper online.
Two singles have been released from this album, " and ".
On his first day Hunter did not make a good first impression with Emily when it became apparent that he was quite clumsy and when Emily asked him if Hunter was his first or last name.
"Kono Mama Zutto" was not included in this album.
He replied that it was his last name, and that his first name was not important, as everyone calls him Hunter.
Aoyama also released "Motions - Thelma Clips Vol.
Later when Emily started to get agitated at Hunter's suggestions for the site, including changing the name of the paper, she decided to head out to Yo's for a drink with Hunter following her.
"Emotions" debuted at No. 9 on the Oricon Daily Chart on its first day.
Once they were there Hunter once again put his foot in it when he commented on Emily's age by saying that people of her “generation” may not understand how the Internet works.
The Seven Lamps of Architecture is an extended essay, first published in May 1849 and written by the English art critic and theorist John Ruskin.
As time went on Hunter once again showed his clumsy side by falling into Emily, with Alison, Casey and Jade looking on thinking that he is her new boy toy.
The 'lamps' of the title are Ruskin's principles of architecture, which he later enlarged upon in the three-volume "The Stones of Venice".
After Emily left, Alison went to talk to Hunter and told him that if he wants Emily to listen to him the best way is to just agree with her.
To an extent, they codified some of the contemporary thinking behind the Gothic Revival.
She then invited him to join her and her friends, but things do not go well when he accidentally knocks Jade's drink all over her and feeling embarrassed he quickly left.
At the time of its publication A. W. N. Pugin and others had already advanced the ideas of the Revival and it was well under way in practice.
When he got back to the office Hunter told Emily that he would met Alison and she s nothing like her, also having taken on board what Alison said Hunter told Emily that she was right about changing the name of the paper, and in doing so she started to warm to him.
Ruskin offered little new to the debate, but the book helped to capture and summarise the thoughts of the movement.
As Emily and Hunter started working together on the new online "Intruder", he continued to point out every mistake she was making which frustrated her causing her to kick Hunter out of the office so that she could concentrate.
"The Seven Lamps" also proved a great popular success, and received the approval of the ecclesiologists typified by the Cambridge Camden Society, who criticised in their publication "The Ecclesiologist" lapses committed by modern architects in ecclesiastical commissions.
Later, Alison arrived at the office looking for Hunter and Emily told her that she has told him to stay away, when Emily asked what she wanted him for Alison told her that Casey was having a barbecue and she wanted to invite him, but also try to fix him up with Jade which Emily told her was not a great idea as Hunter would not know what to do if he had a girlfriend as she was raised by "cyber wolves in a techno forest".
The essay was published in book form in May 1849 and is structured with eight chapters; an introduction and one chapter for each of the seven 'Lamps', which represent the demands that good architecture must meet, expressed as directions in which the association of ideas may take the observer:
When Alison found Hunter at Al's she invited him over to Casey but he was quite confused as to why she would want him there, but he turned down the invitation under the impression that Emily would need him to help her, so Alison told him that they would hang out another time; thinking this meant setting a date Hunter asked when but she had to explain that "another" time is only an expression, which again showed how literally Hunter takes everything in life.
Writing within the essentially British tradition of the associational values that inform aesthetic appreciation, Ruskin argued from a moral stance with polemic tone, that the technical innovations of architecture since the Renaissance and particularly the Industrial Revolution, had subsumed its spiritual content and sapped its vitality.
Afterwards Hunter went back to Worldwide to see how Emily was getting on and his continued to point out every mistake she made and she had to tell him that in order for her to get it right she would have to figure it all out on her own.
He also argued that no new style was needed to redress this problem, as the appropriate styles already existed.
Wanting rid of Hunter again she told him to go to the barbecue that Alison mentioned which at first he was resistant to; however, when she said that if he did not leave one of them would die he quickly changed his mind especially when she told him that Alison had big plans for him.
The essay sketched out the principles which Ruskin later expounded upon in the three-volume "The Stones of Venice" published between 1851 and 1853.
As Hunter and Alison waited for Casey and Jade to arrive, they started talking and learned that they have quite a bit in common, when Alison suggested that he helped by grilling the meat and he started telling her the scientific effects of grilling which confused her, so she offered him a beer and he told her that he does not drink, and she asked if he does not like putting toxins into his body or if he has a sordid past like she does, when Jade and Casey finally arrived he welcomed them by emptying a bag of candy over her.
Practically, he suggested an 'honest' architecture with no veneers, finishes, hidden support nor machined mouldings and that beauty must be derived from nature and crafted by man.
As time passed Hunter showed that he is unable to recognize when people are being literal or telling a joke, and once again Jade become his target when he drops her burger on the floor, feeling out of place Hunter quickly makes his exit.
Ruskin drew upon Archibald Alison's "Essays on the Nature and Principles of Taste" (1790–1810) for some of his principles, such as the requirement of leisured poise as the best state for appreciating beauty, the thought that the natural countryside is more conducive to producing an artist than the city, that the glory of architecture lies in its age.
When he got back to the office he found that Emily had successfully formatted a page for the paper and she asked him how things went at the barbecue and he told her not very well.
"The Seven Lamps" was reduced to the status of a "moral gloss on Alison" by George L. Hersey, in "High Victorian Gothic".
He then showed his interest in Alison and whether she and Emily have different fathers and she told him that they have different biological fathers and mothers, leading Emily to tell him that Alison is biologically her daughter and she explained how this was possible.
He had an abiding confidence in the natural, untutored instinct for rightness and beauty in the average person: "all men have sense of what is right in this matter, if they would only use and apply this sense; every man knows where and how beauty gives him pleasure, if he would only ask for it when he does so, and not allow it to be forced upon him when he does not want it."
When Alison found that she had taken Emily's MP3 player by mistake she called the office and he told her that it would get him out of the office Emily sent him to Casey's to switch them.
This contrasts with the thread of modernism that holds that people must be "taught to appreciate" good design.
When Casey got a call to go into work, Hunter stayed behind to help her paint.
Another contrast with modernism is in the aesthetic of functionality: Ruskin saw no beauty in well-designed tools: beauty is out of place where there is not serene leisure, or "if you thrust it into the places of toil.
While Casey was gone Hunter asked Alison out on a date, much to her surprise, and she had to explain that she was dating Casey and it became clear that he had been misreading the signals and he went to leave but he walked into the paint resting on the ladder.
For Ruskin, Beauty was not an inherent characteristic but a thing that could be applied to an object or withheld from it.
Hunter went back to Worldwide and Emily was shocked to see the state that he was in, and he explained how he asked Alison out but she explained how Alison is seeing Casey, as she started to take Hunter's shirt off he shocked her with a kiss and he explained that he did it because he thought that she was coming on to him in a sexual way when helping him with his shirt later, Alison called to invite Hunter to lunch with her and Casey; however, when he arrived at Al's to see them kissing he decided not to go in and join them.
By 1849, A. W. N. Pugin and others had already advanced the ideas of the Gothic Revival and its popularity was secured.
When Alison graduated from the nursing program, Casey and Emily decide to take her for a dinner, when Emily told Hunter of this he asked if Alison's father had been invited Emily told him that no one had bothered.
Ruskin offered little new to the debate, but the book helped to capture and summarise the thoughts of the movement, proved a great popular success, and received the approval of "The ecclesiologists", the influential newsletter of architectural criticism published by the Cambridge Camden Society.
Thinking that this was just an oversight Hunter contacted Dr. Larry McDermott and when he told Emily of this she told him that Larry is the last person Alison would want to see.
Effects such as the polychromy of High Victorian Gothic architecture may be traced to him, in a genre of "Ruskinian Gothic" that was practised in Britain and colonies like New Zealand and Canada, and in Anglophile strata of the United States.
Hunter later turned up at the Lakeview to stand guard in case Larry decided to turn up, which Emily thought was weird and creepy and said that he has the "intimidation factor of a zygote", when Alison heard Emily telling Hunter to leave she told him to join them but she got a shock when she saw her father standing in the doorway.
Ruskin had made his debut as a critic of architecture with "The Poetry of Architecture" (1839), an essay in the picturesque that he later rejected, "The Seven Lamps" were still tentative steps for Ruskin's architectural criticism and offered a moral creed for architects.
Confused as to why Larry was there Alison got upset especially when she learns that Hunter was behind it, when Hunter left the Lakeview he found Alison and Casey in Old Town and tried to apologize but Casey told him to stay away.
He later went on to disclaim the essay as a 'wretched rant'.
Larry later found Hunter at Java and got confused when he started reciting an apology written on a napkin, but he told Hunter that it was not necessary because even though it was not the best idea it did bring him back into his daughter's life, and feeling that it would help Hunter told Larry where he could find Alison.
Politician Alexander Beresford Hope and architect Butterfield had agreed upon the general details just a month after Ruskin's book was published and by August they had revised their plans to encapsulate the principles it espoused.
Having gone back to Worldwide Hunter again started his apology to a stunned Emily who found it to be a joke, seeing that he was sincerely sorry for his actions she told him not to worry, but that changed when she learned that he had sent Larry after Alison.
All Saints is considered the first Ruskinian building due to its use of brick 'honestly' employed as a structural system rather than for surface decoration.
Emily then called Alison to see how she is and found that Hunter was off the hook as Alison was happy to get the chance to clear the air with Larry, then as Hunter went to leave Emily stopped him and got him to offer her half of his sandwich and told him that there may be hope for him yet.
In the United States, Ralph Waldo Emerson's expectations of a new, authentic American style had prepared the ground: Ruskin's "Seven Lamps" were quickly assimilated into the aesthetics of Transcendentalism.
When Hunter's mother suffered from a stroke it hit him hard and not wanting to go and see his mother alone Alison offered to go with him.
In 1899 Marcel Proust read a translation of Ruskin's chapter "The Lamp of Memory" in a Belgian magazine.
When they got to Chicago, Hunter was worried about what to expect and Alison explained some of the possible symptoms, when the nurse came she told them that only one visitor was allowed at a time.
He projected the transforming experience onto the narrator of "Du côté de chez Swann", who describes himself as a boy reading the piece in the garden at Combray.
Hunter later came back and was in a state of shock after his mother told him that the man he always thought to be his father wasn't.
Later Proust, who translated some works of Ruskin, claimed to know "The Seven Lamps of Architecture" by heart.
Alison tries to reassure him that maybe the stroke had an effect on her memory, but he couldn't handle it and left.
"Seven Lamps of Architecture" and other of Ruskin's writings on architecture are summarized and extensively quoted in John Unrau, "Looking at Architecture with Ruskin" (Toronto: University of Toronto), 1978.
Back at Java Hunter told Alison about his childhood and how he never really knew his father and about his mother's career.
Writing in the preface to the first edition Ruskin remarks;
While hanging out with Alison, Hunter got a call from the home where his mother was staying saying that she was agitated so they headed out to Chicago to see her.
Having much more serious work in hand, and desiring merely to render them illustrative of my meaning, I have sometimes very completely failed even of that humble aim; and the text, being generally written before the illustration was completed, sometimes naively describes as sublime or beautiful features which the plates represents by a blot.
When they got to the home they saw that Aurora (Hunter's mother) was calm and sitting with the nurse, as he approached her she was excited to see him, and asked him to get her out of the home and called him Tristan which confused him and she got upset when he told her that his name wasn't Tristan and she got worse when she saw Alison.
I shall be grateful if the reader will in such cases refer the expressions of praise to the Architecture, and not to the illustrations.
Back at Java, Hunter and Alison discussed why his mother had called him Tristan, and he said that her favorite opera was "Tristan and Isolde", but she suggested that maybe Tristan was a past lover who she kept a secret with and he wondered whether Tristan was his father.
The following illustrations are from the third edition where the situation had been much improved.
As they try figure it out Alison suggests that they look for his father which he agrees to although he was a bit hesitant to begin with, and he tells her that he’d never met anyone like her before which said was a mutual feeling on her part about him.
Qatar–Russia relations  refers to bilateral foreign relations between the two countries, Qatar and Russia.
When, Hunter finally decided that he was ready to look for his father he ran into an upset Alison in Old Town, but instead of comforting her, he made her feel worse.
Following Saudi Arabia's lead, Qatar refused for many years to have diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.
Later they decided to go and see Aurora again; however, this time she's calmer and they play her favorite opera on a CD player and asked her about Tristan.
This changed in the summer of 1988, when diplomatic relations between the two states were established on 2 August.
As they talked to her she started to cry and Alison told him not to pressure her, when he decided to leave she told him that his father's information would be on his birth certificate but he told her that he’d never seen it, so they headed to city hall to get a copy of it.
The Soviet Union opened its embassy in Doha on 12 November 1989, and Qatar opened its embassy in Moscow on 14 November 1989.
When he got a copy he told her that the name on the certificate for his father wasn’t Jeremiah Hunter the man he thought to be his father but that of a Tristan Wagner, so they decided to look him up.
On 26 December 1991, Qatar recognised the Russian Federation as the successor state to the Soviet Union, after the latter's dissolution.
They later found the address of as Tristan Wagner in Chicago but when they got to his apartment they found that he couldn't possibly be Hunter's father.
The current Ambassador of Russia to Qatar is Andrey Vladimirovich Andreyev, who was appointed by President Vladimir Putin on 17 July 2005.
Hunter was sitting in Al's when Alison found him and he told that she’d happily continue to find his father and he told her that his mother had died after suffering from another stroke.
The current Ambassador of Qatar to Russia is Ahmed Saif Al-Midhadi, who appointed his Letters of Credence to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on 27 February 2009.
Casey later turned up to talk to Alison but she wasn’t that open to listen, and when Hunter stood up to Casey for Alison, Casey lashed out at him.
Relations became strained after Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev was assassinated in Qatar on 13 February 2004.
While Alison went to change her shift at the hospital, Emily and Larry arrived at Al's to talk, when she was finished with Larry Emily went over to talk to Hunter to see if he was going into work and she learned of his mother's passing.
On the third anniversary of Yandarbiyev's death, Russian President Vladimir Putin traveled to Qatar on a state visit, where he was received by Emir of Qatar Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani.
As they spoke Hunter told her of the mystery of his father's identity and of his mother's revelation, and when he told her of the name Tristan on his birth certificate Emily starts to suspect something and asks for Hunter's mother's name.
On November 29, 2011, Russian Ambassador to Qatar, Vladimir Titorenko, was allegedly assaulted by Qatar airport security and customs officers when he refused to have his suitcase scanned at the airport.
After Hunter left Al's, Emily found that he’d forgotten an old program from an old performance of Tristan and Isolde and she started to investigate her suspicions, that Larry is Tristan and therefore being Hunter's father she later confronted him at the Lakeview to get some answers.
Relations again became strained on February 7, 2012, when reportedly, after a diplomat from Qatar warned Russia of losing the support of Arab League about upcoming resolution on the Syrian uprising, which Russia and China later vetoed, the answer came harsh from Russian ambassador Vitaly Churkin who replied that "If you talk to me like that, there will be no Qatar today" and boasted about Russian military superiority over Qatar.
Alison arrived at Hunter's room, he told her of his anger towards his mother and her revelation, and they got close and ended up kissing, until Alison stops them saying that she's still not over Casey and he's grieving and she told him that sleeping with him was tempting but would have been a mistake.
Later, Russia denied all these accusations.
As Hunter and Alison talked things through Casey turned up and got the wrong end of the stick so Alison, and started to berate Alison for something she hadn’t done and Hunter stood up for her.
Russian and Qatar gas producers agree to develop oil refineries in Yamal Peninsula along with halal reindeer meat.
Later, Hunter turned up at Worldwide and started packing up his stuff and he told Emily that he's quitting, when he couldn’t find his coffee mug which Emily had taken h decided to leave it behind and she told him to call her before leaving and once he left she phoned her friend at the hospital lab and order a DNA test.
12 Feb 2007 in Doha in the framework of the official program of the visit to Qatar of the President of Russian Federation Vladimir Putin signed an Agreement to establish a Russian-Qatari Business Council.
After getting the DNA results, Emily turned up at Hunter's room and told him that he couldn't leave because she had to tell him something important.
She was born in Madrid and studied Spanish and Classical ballet at the Royal High School of Dance.
As Emily tried desperately to get Hunter to stay in Oakdale he was extremely resistant thinking she only wanted him to stay so that he could help her at "The Intruder", but she told him that it had nothing to do with that and that she's his mother.
She has danced at the Teatro de la Zarzuela in Madrid and the Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona.
Confused at her revelation Hunter takes it hard thinking that she's messing with him to get him to stay, but she explains to him how even though Aurora raised him she wasn't his biological mother, because he's her biological son in the same way that Alison is her biological daughter.
She was a soloist with Jose Antonio y los Ballets Españoles for one year and danced with Joaquín Cortés in "Pasión Gitana" for 4 years.
Still not understanding what she was telling him Emily told him how her fertilized eggs were stolen and transferred to the University of Chicago where his mother worked, and she was then implanted with one of the eggs; however, Hunter still chose not to believe what she was saying to him.
Since 2002, she has danced in the opera "La vida breve" by Manuel de Falla under the direction of Rafael Frühbeck de Burgos throughout the United States and Europe, including with the New York Philharmonic, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra, and the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra.
As she tried to get Hunter to understand Emily suggested that maybe because of her age Aurora couldn’t get pregnant in the traditional way and knew that Larry could help her but he's confused as to how his mother knew Larry, until Emily told him that Larry admitted being his mother's lover and that his money clip was engraved "To Tristan From Isolde" and he told her of how his mother once called him Tristan after her stroke and she promised to keep his secret forever.
Nuria Pomares directs her own school of dance, which she founded in 1983.
Struggling to accept the news Hunter asked Emily for proof and she gave him the DNA results which confirmed that she's his mother and she tells him that he was a little wrong thinking he had no family in town, because he has her along with his grandmother Susan, his half-brother Daniel.
She has danced in the Washington National Opera, Plácido Domingo (2009) in From my latin soul.
He then asked her about Alison and said that if Daniel's his half-brother then she must be his half-sister, but Emily explained that she's his sister as they have the same biological parents, which made him feel sick and he quickly left the room leaving a confused Emily behind.

Later, Alison finds Hunter at Java but when she reached out and touched his shoulder he quickly pulled away telling her never to touch him.
For high-level synthesis (HLS or C synthesis), HLV is to HLS as functional verification is to logic synthesis.
He then had to explain to her that nothing could never happen between them because, every time that he's with her the thoughts he has are those that one should never have about their sister, and he was confused to find that she didn’t know what he was talking about.
Electronic digital hardware design has evolved from low level abstraction at gate level to register transfer level (RTL), the abstraction level above RTL is commonly called high-level, ESL, or behavioral/algorithmic level.
Hunter then explained to Alison how they have the same biological parents, and they then discovered why they had some special connection, but he felt that he had to leave as the feelings he had for her were too toxic and strong, but she was willing to see where their new sibling relationship lead and that she understood what he was going through as she went through he same thing when she learned that Emily was her biological mother and that it didn’t change how she felt because, Susan was her true mother as she raised her in the same way that Aurora raised him, but was unable to accept it Hunter chose to leave town.
In high-level synthesis, behavioral/algorithmic designs in ANSI C/C++/SystemC code is synthesized to RTL, which is then synthesized into gate level through logic synthesis.
Afterwards, Alison went to see Emily and told her how Hunter thought he was in love with her, much to Emily's horror and she gets even more hurt when Alison tells her how Hunter left, because she wanted a new child and now she learned that she already had one.
Functional verification is the task to make sure a design at RTL or gate level conforms to a specification.
Wanting to find some kind of clue as to where Hunter was Emily, went to his room and was shocked to find that Hunter hadn't left but was asleep under a load of clothes in his bed and was a bit worse for wear.
As logic synthesis matures, most functional verification is done at the higher abstraction, i.e. at RTL level, the correctness of logic synthesis tool in the translating process from RTL description to gate netlist is a less concern today.
As she tried to help him he told her to stop acting like his mother and she again reiterated how he's stuck with her whether he liked it or not, and he hurts her by saying that even though they have some biological connection he wants nothing to do with her.
High-level synthesis is still an emerging technology, so High-level verification today has two important areas under development
Not wanting to pressure Hunter, Emily told him that all she wants is to be a close friend of his, and asked him to go for lunch with her; while she waited for him to get ready Emily phoned Alison to come with them along with Susan.
The tetraploid complementation assay is a technique in biology in which cells of two mammalian embryos are combined to form a new embryo.
Later Emily and Hunter head to the Lakeview to meet Susan and first Susan thought that Emily was repeating her mistake with Casey, until Emily explained how Hunter is her son because one of her fertilized eggs was given to Hunter's mother.
It is used to construct genetically modified organisms, to study the consequences of certain mutations on embryonal development, and in the study of pluripotent stem cells.
When Alison arrived along with Larry, Susan gets confused as to why the latest family revelation concerned him and is shocked and angered when she learns that he's Hunter's biological father, especially as everything happened when he was still married to her.
Normal mammalian somatic cells are diploid: each chromosome (and thus every gene) is present in duplicate (excluding genes from X chromosome absent in Y chromosome).
When Larry told Hunter that he would like to be a father to him, he got upset and left telling them all, that he doesn’t want anything to do with them and Alison followed him out.
The assay starts with producing a "tetraploid" cell in which every chromosome exists fourfold.
When she caught up with him in Old Town, and she tells him that he shouldn’t run away from his newfound family and that they should accept their new relationship and that she's ready to have a brother in her life and how Emily and Susan are always there when you need them.
This is done by taking an embryo at the two-cell stage and fusing the two cells by applying an electrical current.
Later they went back to the Lakeview and they see that Larry's gone after literally being kicked out by Susan, but Emily says that they should focus on the fact that Hunter's now officially a part of the Stewart family but he told her not to push it.
The resulting tetraploid cell will continue to divide, and all daughter cells will also be tetraploid.
After finishing lunch Hunter tells Alison that it may be awhile before he can consider them all family but she tells him that despite the Stewarts' reputation in Oakdale they’re not that bad, and she told him that they don't take being alone lightly in the family so he should just get used to it.
Such a tetraploid embryo can develop normally to the blastocyst stage and will implant in the wall of the uterus.
When Riley (Adam) turned up at the Lakeview he initially thinks that she and Hunter are together, but she explains that he's really her brother.
The tetraploid cells can form the extra-embryonic tissue (placenta etc.), however a proper fetus will rarely develop.
He asked her whether Casey knew as it would help them because he can’t be jealous of Hunter if he's her brother but she says that it won’t change anything.
In the tetraploid complementation assay, one now combines such a tetraploid embryo (either at the morula or blastocyst stage) with normal diploid embryonic stem cells (ES) from a different organism.
Casey later turned up at Memorial after learning of Alison and Hunter's new connection but he failed to apologise in an appropriate way and Hunter told him to take a hint as Alison didn’t need him in her life.
The embryo will then develop normally; the fetus is exclusively derived from the ES cell, while the extra-embryonic tissues are exclusively derived from the tetraploid cells.
After, Alison explained to Casey that they had broken up when he walked into Hunter's room, and she told him that she doesn’t need him in her life.
A nitrilium ion is a nitrile that has been protonated, [RCNH], or alkylated, [RCNR′].
After cutting her ties with Casey, Hunter tried to comfort Alison but when he put his arm around her things got extremely awkward and he left.
Nitriles are only weakly basic and are poor nucleophiles, but they will attack very reactive electrophiles such as carbocations.
While Hunter was formatting pages on the website he was shocked to see Larry enter the office to see him, and he offers to give Hunter something of his mother's but Emily arrives before he can answer.
Nitrilium salts can be prepared by reacting nitriles with trialkyloxonium salts.
When Emily started berating Larry and telling him to stay away from her family Hunter, told her that he didn’t need her to defend him.
The nitrilium ions thus formed can then be reduced to secondary amines with sodium borohydride in diglyme.
Hunter then accepted the gift Larry had which was an old music box of his mother's, Emily then told him to leave and Hunter agreed.
Nitrilium ions are believed to be intermediates in the hydrolysis of nitriles, the Beckmann rearrangement, the Friedel-Crafts cyclization of amines to isoquinolines, the Schmidt reaction with ketones, and the Ugi, Ritter, Pinner and Passerini reactions.
After, Hunter decided to stay busy with work but got upset when he thought of how his mother kept everything special to her from him, and Emily told her that he is not alone as he has family, but he continued to reject her as his mother.
Information about the play can be found at http://www.burkecohenent.com/439032480.
Hunter then went to find Alison at Memorial and invited her to lunch but she told him that she is going to Casey's party which he doesn’t take well as he doesn’t understand why it's still important to her; in the end to help her Hunter decided to go to the party with her.
The play had a workshop run in July 2009 at the "Dog Run Repertory Company," and a rewritten version had an Off-Broadway run in the Spring of 2012 Off Broadway at The Roundabout Theater's Harold and Mimi Steinberg Theatre Center.
When they got to party Margo and everyone else were wondering how Alison knew Hunter and he explained how he's her brother much to everyone's amazement, especially Lisa who wondered how Susan could have a child that no one knew about, so Alison and Hunter explain about the situation with the stolen fertilized eggs, which made Larry his biological father and Emily his biological mother.
That production was filmed and the film was broadcast nationally on PBS and can be viewed at digitaltheatre.com.
After Tom told Hunter that he should meet his half-brother Daniel, and without knowing the details Hunter asks Tom if he was married to Emily much to Margo's horror and when he asked how he could have a child with Emily not having been married to her things get a bit awkward.
On May 2, 2016, "The Soap Myth" was presented as a reading at the Bruno Walter Auditorium at the Lincoln Center Library for the Performing Arts.
When Casey arrived and saw that Alison has come he was happy to see her and to help them Adam distracted Hunter to give them time alone, when they went outside Hunter continued to spy on them and got agitated when he saw them getting close, he then told her that it was time to leave but she chose to stay behind with Casey so he left alone.
The reading, directed by Pam Berlin, starred legendary 7-time Emmy Award winning actor Ed Asner and 2-time Tony Award nominee Jayne Atkinson.
Emily later found Hunter at the office and tried to talk to him about his grief and how it's hard for everyone but that you have to move on in time, and she told him how she's not trying to replace his mother and that even if they couldn’t be family that maybe they could be good friends and see how things go, but he doesn’t give her an answer.
The cast also included Blair Baker and Donald Corren.
At the office, Emily told Hunter that was working on a story but was going to get some breakfast and he wondered why she was always trying to feed him but she offered to go for a working breakfast with him, but he said that he had to take care of his mother's ashes and she got a strange feeling knowing that his mother was in the office and she told him to figure something out as it was too crowded for the three of them.
The reading, produced by Burke-Cohen Entertainment, was the flagship event of Remembrance Readings, a national program in honor of Holocaust Memorial Day presented by the National Jewish Theater Foundation.
While he was working Lucinda turned up at the office looking for Emily and he told her his plans for "The Intruder".
From January 22 to February 1, 2018, "The Soap Myth" enjoyed a brief tour starring Ed Asner as Holocaust survivor Milton Saltzman and two time Tony Award nominee Johanna Day in the dual roles of Holocaust scholar Esther Feinman and Holocaust denier Brenda Goodsen.
Later Hunter went to find Emily at Al's as she was talking to Paul to tell her that Lucinda was looking for her.
Blair Baker again played Annie Blumberg and Ned Eisenberg played the roles that had previously been played by Donald Corren.
When Emily finds Lucinda she was shocked to learn that her job was no longer available and that Hunter would be taking over, which she saw as a way of him putting her in her place, and she told him that if her didn't want her to be his mom that was fine but he didn't have to get her fired.
The play was again directed by Pam Berlin.
When Emily walked out of the office Lucinda told Hunter to let her go and he berated her for firing Emily as she is "The Intruder" which Lucinda failed to acknowledge, and even though he loved his job, in support of Emily, Hunter quit.
The largely sold-out performances were at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts in Miami Beach, FL, the Adolph and Rose Levis Jewish Community Center in Boca Raton, FL, the Parker Playhouse in Fort Lauderdale, FL, the Zeiterion Theater Performing Arts Center in New Bedford, MA, Congregation Rodeph Shalom in Philadelphia, PA, The Museum of Jewish Heritage in Battery Park City, New York City, and Hofstra University in Hempstead, Long Island, NY.
Marián Olejník (born 1976) is a Slovak slalom canoeist who competed at the international level from 1993 to 2007.
"The Soap Myth" dramatizes the powerful confrontation between survivor memory and historical memory and depicts the insidiousness of Holocaust denial.
He won three medals at the ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships with two silvers (C2: 2005, C2 team: 1999) and a bronze (C2 team: 2006).
More than a half century after World War II, at the desperate urging of a passionate survivor, a young investigative reporter finds herself caught between numerous versions of the same story and trying to separate fact from fiction.
At the European Championships he has won a total of 5 medals (2 golds, 1 silver and 2 bronzes).
Did the Nazis make soap from the corpses of their murdered Jewish victims?
His partner in the C2 boat throughout the whole of his active career was Milan Kubáň.
Played out against the backdrop of deadline reporting and journalistic integrity, Jeff Cohen's critically acclaimed play The Soap Myth uses this horrific possibility as its catalyst.
Mahindra World City, Chennai is India's first operational Special Economic Zone (SEZ) and India's first Integrated Business City.
It questions who deserves the right to write history — those who have lived it and remember, those studying and protecting it, or those seeking to distort its very existence?
It is a Public Private Partnership promoted by the Mahindra Group and TIDCO (Govt of Tamil Nadu Enterprise).
And finally, what responsibility should others take once they know the truth?
Mahindra World City Located outside Chennai city was inaugurated on 21 September 2002 by the Hon’ble Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Puratchi Thalaivi Ms J Jayalalitha.
Although "The Soap Myth" is a work of fiction, it is, in the words of the program, "inspired by real people and real events as well as an article written by Josh Rolnick in "Moment" magazine profiling Holocaust survivor Morris Spitzer."
Built on the model of sustainable urbanisation Mahindra World City grew from a bed of business, infrastructure and sustainable practices before evolving into a completely integrated city within a decade of its inauguration.
Foremost among the play's historical inspirations is the evidence that the Nazi regime had a program at the Danzig Anatomic Institute in 1944 to develop a process for the mass-production of soap from the fat of Jews being slaughtered in Nazi extermination camps, and produced soap in small quantities at a nearby concentration camp.
Situated on the NH 45, Mahindra World City is located 50 km from Chennai city.
In a dramatic moment, the players re-enact testimony from the Nuremberg Trials, including this recipe:
It is one of the largest integrated business cities on the Golden Quadrilateral spread over 1,500 acres (6.1 km2).
5 kilos of human fat are mixed with 10 liters of water and 500 or 1,000 grams of caustic soda.
It is surrounded by rolling hills, a reserve forest and natural lakes.
The soap floats to the surface while the water and other sediment remain at the bottom.
Several engineering colleges, educational and technical institutions are located along this corridor around MWC, Chennai.
A bit of salt and soda is added to this mixture.
The core purpose of the city was building a source of Livelihood from which social infrastructure and then residential would evolve.
Then fresh water is added and the mixture again boiled 2 or 3 hours.
It has drawn businesses from different parts of the globe to set up in India.
After having cooled, the soap is poured into molds."
Mahindra World City is now a mature business district with leading companies such as Infosys, BMW, Braun, TTK Group, Capgemini, Njmestronics, Renault-Nissan, Tech Mahindra, Wabco, Lincoln Electric, Wipro, Timken, cyber vole and TVS Group, parker among others having set up within its premises.
The play's central character, is an elderly Holocaust survivor called Milton Saltzman, worked doggedly to establish as fact the idea that the Nazis produced and used soap made from human corpses, even handing bars of such soap to Jews on their way into the sealed chambers that functioned alternately as gas chambers and as shower rooms in the Nazi concentration camps.
Being one of the largest IT parks in the area along with a host of other industries 25,000 + employees and professionals have found employment within the walls of this city.
The second character is a young journalist called Annie Blumberg assigned to write a story about Saltzman.
BMW’s latest vehicle the 3 Series Gran Turismo was rolled out of their plant in MWC Chennai.
She is soon caught between her sympathies for Saltzman and the adamant stand of a number of distinguished scholars of the Holocaust who refuse to publish the Nazi manufacture of soap as fact despite a large amount of eyewitness testimony, including the eyewitness testimony of both Nazis and British prisoners of war at the Nuremberg trial who worked in the experimental soap manufacturing facility at Danzig in 1944, because contemporary documentation is lacking.
The layout of the city is broken up in to Zones by the utility of the land.
Two characters representing historians of the Holocaust argue strongly that although a large number of eyewitnesses including former British POWs, Nazis, and Holocaust survivors have testified about the soap production, because no actual laboratory or production records survive as physical documents, any publication about the production of soap will be used by Holocaust deniers to discredit the reality of the Holocaust itself and, therefore, that no assertions that any soap production took place should be published.
There are 3 sector-specific Special Economic Zones (SEZs) - IT (Services and Manufacturing), Auto Ancillaries and Apparel and Fashion Accessories, a Domestic Tariff Area and a Residential / Social zone.
A character called Brenda Goodsen, an amalgam of a number of Holocaust deniers including David Irving, appears in the play to demonstrate the evil of anti-Semitism in the form of Holocaust Denial.
Spread across 285 acres, the Residential zone has been planned to provide living spaces supported by modern social infrastructure to over 6,000 families across diverse segments.
This character delivers a speech for minimizing the Holocaust and concluding that the Jews brought it on themselves.
The MWC administration operates as the municipal corporation for the city with responsibility for the provision, upkeep and maintenance of the infrastructure and other facilities.
Holocaust historian Robert Melvin Spector concludes that the Nazis "did indeed use human fat for the making of soap at Stutthof," albeit in limited quantity.
Mahindra World City is well connected by both road and rail links, with Paranur railway station on site.
The material in the Nuremberg Trial scenes in the play use as dialogue actual testimony given by British prisoners of war and by Nazis at the historical trials about the development of an industrial process for producing soap from human bodies at the Danzig Anatomic Institute, the production of such soap on a small-scale basis at Stutthof concentration camp, and the actual use of this soap by Nazi personnel.
It is 35 km away from Chennai International airport and 55 km from Chennai Seaport.
A film, directed by Ron Kopp and Mr. Mittelman, was made of the National Jewish Theater production.
Paranur railway station is a public private partnership initiative between Mahindra World City and Southern Railways.
That film will be broadcast nationally through American Public Television on PBS stations across the country.
It is the first railway station to be redesigned and maintained by the corporate sector.
The sponsoring station, WPBT2 in Miami, will air the premiere broadcast on January 27, 2014.
Mahindra World School opened in June 2008.
Ron Kopp also directed "I Will Refuse to Bubble: History and Theater as Defiance," a documentary about the making of "The Soap Myth" that examines the question of who has the right to write history, highlighting the importance of theater in understanding the world's most incomprehensible events.
The coeducational school based on the CBSE syllabus is currently functional from classes kindergarten to standard Xll, with 843 students and 65 teachers.
Featuring Holocaust survivor Irving Roth and scholars Michael Berenbaum, David Marwell and Bonnie Gurewitsch, it also is distributed online by Digital Theatre.
The school will cater both to the schooling needs of the children of Mahindra World City employees/residents as well as of those residing in surrounding areas.
He is now known for his arguments against William Sherlock, who had justified the change of monarch of 1688-9 and his own switch of sides in "The Case of the Allegiance".
Designed by the architect, Hafeez, the school is spread over a 5-acre (20,000 m2) campus nestled amidst sylvan surroundings.
According to J. P. Kenyon, Kettlewell's reply made a case "with which conformist Anglicans could only agree, because it was spiritual, while Sherlock's was resolutely aspiritual".
The school has received the National School Sanitation Award in 2012.
He went on to attack defenders of the Glorious Revolution generally as proponents of fallacious contractarian theories.
Mahindra Research Valley, the key research wing of the Mahindra Group is housed on 125 acres at the Mahindra World City, Chennai, MRV has been designed by Padma Vibhushan, Shri Charles Correa.
He was the second son of John Kettlewell, a merchant at Northallerton, Yorkshire, by his wife, Elizabeth Ogle, was born 10 March 1653, and was educated at Northallerton Grammar School under Thomas Smelt, a royalist, whose other pupils included George Hickes, William Palliser, Thomas Burnet, Thomas Rymer, and John Radcliffe.
It is home to over 1,500 engineers and designers working in one of the most modern automobile and tractor R&D facility in India.
Kettlewell matriculated at St Edmund Hall, Oxford on 11 November 1670, and graduated B.A. 20 June 1674.
There is a mosque constructed by United Islamic Welfare Association (UNIWAS) inside Mahindra city situated in Blossom avenue besides Downtown stay in the road opposite to Canopy.
On Radcliffe's resignation of a fellowship at Lincoln College, Oxford, Kettlewell was elected in his place in July 1675, with the backing of George Hickes, then himself a Fellow.
The Mahindra Group has plans to replicate this model of an integrated business city with industrial, residential and social infrastructure at Gummidipoondi in north part of Chennai.
For about five years he acted as tutor in college, and proceeded M.A. 3 May 1677.
The Gummidipoondi facility will cover 1,000 acres (4.0 km2) abutting NH5 will mainly focus on Domestic Tariff Area (DTA).
He was ordained deacon by John Fell in Christ Church Cathedral 10 June 1677, and priest 24 February 1678.
It will also have a logistics park and a residential park.
The reputation which his first book made for him led to his appointment as chaplain to Anne, Countess of Bedford, and to his presentation by Simon Digby, 4th Baron Digby to the vicarage of Coleshill, Warwickshire (December 1682).
These are the results of the men's horizontal bar competition, one of eight events for male competitors in artistic gymnastics at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul.
He resigned his fellowship at Lincoln College on 22 November 1683, devoted himself to his parish, where he preached the high church doctrine of passive obedience.
The qualification and final rounds took place on September 18, 20 and 24th at the Olympic Gymnastics Hall.
In 1685 Kettlewell married.
Eighty-nine gymnasts competed in the horizontal bar event during the compulsory and optional rounds on September 18 and 20.
Through the Glorious Revolution he preached strongly against rebellion; he adhered consistently to this principle, and was deprived of his vicarage in 1690.
The eight highest scoring gymnasts advanced to the final on September 24.
He moved to London, and spent the remainder of his life, occupied in the composition of devotional books and controversial tracts.
Each country was limited to two competitors in the final.
Shortly before his death he proposed to Bishop Thomas Ken the establishment of a fund for the relief of the suffering deprived clergy; and circulars asking for subscriptions were issued.
Half of the points earned by each gymnast during both the compulsory and optional rounds carried over to the final.
But the charitable scheme was regarded by the government as a seditious usurpation of authority, and prosecutions were instituted.
This constitutes the "prelim" score.
Kettlewell died at his house in Gray's Inn Lane on 12 April 1695, at the age of 42.
(Lucius) Valerius Maximus (Basilius) (fl. 4th century) was a Roman senator who was appointed consul in AD 327.
He was buried on 15 April in the church of All Hallows Barking, in the same grave in which William Laud had been interred, and was commemorated in a Latin inscription on a marble tablet erected by his widow at the east end of the church.
Valerius Maximus was a member of the fourth century patrician gens Valeria, and probably the son of Valerius Maximus Basilius, urban prefect of Rome in 319.
At Kettlewell's funeral Ken officiated for the only time in public after his deprivation.
He served as the "Vicarius Orientis" in AD 325 before being appointed the eastern Praetorian prefect, probably in late 326, when the emperor Constantine I returned from Italy.
Kettlewell had married at Whitchurch, near Reading, on 4 October 1685, Jane, daughter of Anthony Lybb of Hardwick House in the parish of Whitchurch; they had no children.
This was an unusual appointment, as the office of Praetorian prefect was reserved for members of the Equestrian order, not senators, and it displayed the emperor’s confidence in Valerius Maximus, allowing him to exercise command over the extensive resources of the east.
His papers were entrusted by his widow to Robert Nelson, who published some of them.
He continued to serve Constantine in this role throughout 327 and 328, relinquishing the office in early 329 after Constantine returned from Gaul.
His first book, 'The Measures of Christian Obedience,' a summary of Christian morals as involved in obedience to the laws of the Gospel, was written between Christmas 1677 and Easter 1678, but was not published until 1681, when, at Hickes's suggestion, Kettlewell dedicated it to Henry Compton, bishop of London, but this dedication he suppressed after Compton had appeared in military array on behalf of the Prince of Orange.
During this period, in AD 327, Valerius Maximus was appointed "consul posterior", alongside Flavius Constantius.
His second publication resulted from his parochial work; he was in the habit of preaching preparation-sermons before communion, eight or nine times in the year, and of these he printed a summary in 1683 under the title of "An Help and Exhortation to Worthy Communicating", dedicating the book to Lord Digby.
Then in late AD 331, he was probably sent to Gaul with the "Caesar" Constantius II, serving as Constantius’ Praetorian Prefect.
Shortly after the suppression of Monmouth's rebellion he preached a sermon, in his collected works with the title of "Measures of Christian Subjection."
Valerius Maximus served him there until late 333 or early 334, when Constantius returned to his father’s court at Constantinople.
As a supplement to his first book, that on "Christian Obedience", he published in February 1687-8 his "Practical Believer", which passed through many editions.
In around AD 336, Valerius Maximus was appointed Praetorian Prefect for a third time, this time accompanying the "Caesar" Dalmatius to the provinces along the Danubian frontier, which had been assigned to him as the territory he was to manage, in Constantine’s planned administrative division of the empire.
A treatise on the new oaths was left by him in manuscript, but never printed.
He served under Dalmatius until 337, when Valerius Maximus was replaced shortly before the murder of Dalmatius in the wake of the death of Constantine I.
Studio Miraval is a recording studio in Correns in southern France, situated in the heart of the department of Var near the French Riviera.
It is speculated that Valerius Maximus was married twice.
Many famous musicians have recorded there, including Rammstein, Sade, AC/DC, The Cure, and Shirley Bassey.
His first marriage may have been to a Septimia, a daughter of Septimius Bassus.
The recording studio itself measures with a ceiling.
They possibly had one son together, named Lucius Valerius Septimius Bassus.
The studio was created in 1977 by jazz pianist Jacques Loussier and sound engineer Patrice Quef.
His second marriage was possibly to a Vulcacia, supposedly the daughter of a Neratius Junius Flavianus.
Loussier began by recording his own work, mainly for films, and then started taking on French clients such as Maxime Le Forestier and Pierre Vassiliu.
It has been postulated that they had two children, a son, Valerius Maximus Basilius, and a daughter, Valeria, who may have become a Christian through her possible marriage to a Rufius Maecius Placidus.
Miraval achieved fame thanks to Pink Floyd, who came there in 1979 to record part of their album "The Wall", the liner notes of which credit Miraval.
The Lauenburg Lakes Nature Park  was founded in 1961 and lies in the district of Lauenburg in the southeastern part of the German state of Schleswig-Holstein.
Subsequently, equipped with one of the first SSL mixing consoles in France, Miraval recorded AC/DC, The Cure, Muse, Wham!
It is right on the border with the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in the Schleswig-Holstein Uplands, a Young Drift moraine landscape that formed during the Weichselian glaciation of the last ice age.
In 1992, Loussier sold Miraval to an American buyer.
With an area of over 470 km the nature park is the third largest in Schleswig-Holstein and contains extensive stretches of forest.
The studio remained active, in particular for the recording of Jacques' trio's albums.
The Lauenburg Lakes Nature Park, there are 40 lakes in total, borders directly on the Mecklenburg biosphere reserve of Schaalsee and, together, they form a large nature reserve along the former Inner German Border.
Since 2003, when Courtney Love spent several weeks there, the studio has throttled back, and it has suffered from the declining record sales plaguing the music industry in the 2000s.
The largest lakes in the nature park are the Ratzeburger See and the Schaalsee, which are linked together by the Schaalsee Canal that begins near Salem.
Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have been renting Miraval since the summer of 2008, which probably hinders commercial exploitation of the recording studio.
Within the nature park are the district towns of Ratzeburg and Mölln as well as the Hellbach Valley.
His primary vehicle was the #18 self-owned Pontiac machine; although he would occasionally drive a Hudson vehicle on the race track.
The Old Salt Road from Lüneburg to Lübeck runs through the nature park – at several places, such as Fredeburg, still as a medieval route - the Alte Salzstraße.
He raced in the NASCAR Grand National Series from 1953 to 1956.
The nature park is roughly bordered to the west between Berkenthin and Büchen by the Elbe-Lübeck Canal.
Like J.D. McDuffie, Alan Kulwicki, and Joe Nemechek, Mounts was an "independent" race car driver who would never receive manufacturer's support or the support of blockbuster sponsors.
The Naturparkweg nature trail runs through the park and links it to the other four nature parks in Schleswig-Holstein.
Arden would earn six finishes in the top ten from the 37 races that he would compete in NASCAR.
The watershed between the North and Baltic Seas also runs through the nature park.
The 1954 Grand National season would see Mounts record his best championship finish at 21st place in the standings.
The United States' Federal Bureau of Investigation instituted an Honorary Medals Program in 1989 as a way of recognizing "exceptional acts" by FBI employees and other law enforcement personnel working with the FBI.
During his career, Mounts would earn $2,505 in race winnings ($ when adjusted for inflation) and race 4489 laps - the equivalent of .
These medals were created to supplement the then-existing reward system within the Bureau.
Only the 1953 and 1956 NASCAR Cup Series seasons would see him finish better than he started in the races.
There are four medals in the program intended for personnel: the FBI Star, the FBI Medal for Meritorious Achievement, the FBI Shield of Bravery, and the FBI Medal of Valor.
Mounts would end up losing nearly one position on average from start to finish during his entire career.
One additional medal, the FBI Memorial Star, is for a surviving relative when a death has occurred in the line of duty.
His appearance at the 1955 Southern 500, where he would crash into Don Duckworth's stalled vehicle, would be captured on highlight films for generations.
These medals are considered to be among the highest honors granted by the FBI, and fewer than 400 had been awarded as of March 2009.
While Bill Champion managed to avoid Duckworth by swerving past the vehicle rapidly, Arden Mounts managed to see the stalled vehicle too late and crashed into him in a very hard manner.
"The FBI Star is awarded for serious injury sustained in the direct line of duty from physical confrontation with criminal adversaries, an injury inflicted by weapons, gunshot wounds inflicted in the line of duty, or an injury so severe that it would require substantial emergency room sutures, hospitalization, or comprehensive medical treatment for a sustained period of time."
The proper usage of seat belts on the stock car automobiles would save the lives of both Mounts and Duckworth.
One recipient of the FBI Star is Major Peter Norton of the British Army, who was severely injured when he triggered a secondary explosive device while attempting to clear an area where five American soldiers had been killed by a roadside bomb.
The types of racing tracks that best favored Arden was the dirt tracks where he finished an average of 18th place; intermediate tracks were very much a disadvantage to Mounts, where a finish of 42nd place was the career average for him.
Norton was also awarded the George Cross—the highest British award for acts of gallantry which did not take place in action directly against enemy forces, and also awarded for civilian gallantry—for this incident.
Mounts would die while being a patient at St. Mary's Hospital, a medical center in Huntington, West Virginia.
"The FBI Medal for Meritorious Achievement is awarded for extraordinary and exceptional meritorious service in a duty of extreme challenge and great responsibility, extraordinary and exceptional achievements in connection with criminal or national security cases or projects, or a decisive, exemplary act that results in the protection or the direct saving of life in severe jeopardy in the line of duty."
In addition, the company supports the classical guitar and guitarists by presenting several annual New York guitar series at the Manhattan School of Music, the Queen Sofia Spanish Institute and other important venues, by commissioning hundreds of original solo and chamber music works and concertos from some of the foremost contemporary composers, by donating thousands of dollars for scholarships, special artist's projects and guitar festivals, and by publishing Guitar Review magazine.
Supervisory Special Agent Harold Bickmore of the FBI was awarded the Medal for Meritorious Achievement for saving the life of a sixteen-year-old girl whom he found on the ground not breathing at the scene of a traffic accident on a major four-lane highway.
In 1926-7, Albert Augustine (born Denmark 1900, died New York City, April, 1967) moved to the United States to pursue his career as a luthier.
He administered first aid on the spot, including CPR without any protection from blood-borne disease.
In 1928, he married his wife, Rose.
"The FBI Shield of Bravery is presented for brave and courageous acts occurring in the line of duty or within the scope of FBI employment which may extend to major assistance to a task force or undercover operation, grave situations, or crisis confrontations associated with the highest priority cases of the FBI."
During this period, he experimented with different types of strings without significant result.
Shields of Bravery were awarded to Special Agent Ronald Eowan Sr, Regional Security Officer Earl Miller of the State Department, and former Special Agent Paul Myers.
It was to be almost 20 years before his collaboration with famed guitarist Andrés Segovia would result in the development of the nylon guitar string.
They spent nearly four years in Indonesia under primitive conditions orchestrating a "highly complex ruse" that led to the arrests of 12 terrorists and the disruption of their network.
In the mid-1940s, Andrés Segovia mentioned the shortage of good guitar strings in the United States, particularly his favorite Pirastro catgut strings, to a number of foreign diplomats at a party, including General Lindeman of the British Embassy.
"The FBI Medal of Valor is presented in recognition of an exceptional act of heroism or voluntary risk of personal safety and life, and this act must have occurred in the direct line of duty or within the scope of FBI employment and in the face of criminal adversaries."
A month later, the General presented Segovia with some nylon strings which he had obtained via some members of the DuPont family.
Special Agent Robert Merta was grazed by a bullet when he tackled a fugitive prison escapee who had drawn his gun on Merta and three other agents when they tried to arrest him.
Segovia found that although the strings produced a clear sound, they had a faint metallic timbre which he hoped could be eliminated.
Merta received the Medal of Valor for risking his life to protect his fellow agents.
Nylon strings were first tried on stage by Olga Coelho in New York in January, 1944.
"The FBI Memorial Star is presented to a surviving relative where death has occurred in the line of duty as the direct result of an adversarial action."
In 1946, Segovia and Augustine were introduced by their mutual friend Vladimir Bobri, editor of "Guitar Review".
The family of Special Agent Paul M. Sorce, who died as a result of an auto accident in the line of duty, was given a Memorial Star.
On the basis of Segovia's interest and Augustine's past experiments, they decided to pursue the development of nylon strings.
(–)-2β-Carbomethoxy-3β-(4-bromophenyl)tropane (RTI-"4229"-51, bromopane) is a semi-synthetic alkaloid in the phenyltropane group of psychostimulant compounds.
DuPont, skeptical of the idea, agreed to supply the nylon if Augustine would endeavor to develop and produce the actual strings.
First publicized in the 1990s, it has not been used enough to have gained a fully established profile.
After three years of development, Augustine demonstrated a nylon first string whose quality impressed guitarists, including Segovia, in addition to DuPont.
RTI-51 can be expected to have properties lying somewhere in between RTI-31 and RTI-55.
Eventually, however, after experimenting with various types of metal and smoothing and polishing techniques, Augustine was also able to produce high quality nylon wound strings.
Importantly it has a ratio of monoamine reuptake inhibition of D > S > N (1.8:10.6:37.4nM respectively) which is an unusual balance of effects not produced by other commonly used compounds (although RTI-121 is similar, but more DAT selective).
Augustine suffered a heart attack in 1948, but survived.
It has been used in its Br radiolabelled form to map the distribution of dopamine transporters in the brain.
He commissioned a guitar from Augustine in 1956 which was never finished.
Modern research seems to confirm the above hypothesis.
Augustine died of his second heart attack in 1967.
However, earlier work produced more scattered results.
Under Rose Augustine and following her death in 2003, the company continues to produce nylon strings and support the field of classical guitar.
Based upon what is obvious from the table, RTI-31, RTI-51, and RTI-55 are all similarly potent TRIs.

Matfield is the "most-capped lock for any nation" in rugby history, with all of his 120 appearances at that position.
Between 1982–1994, American radio and media personality Howard Stern hosted a number of pay-per-view specials and released various VHS and audio tapes.
The "most-capped back" is Percy Montgomery, whose 102 caps made him the country's leader until first being equalled by John Smit and later surpassed by Matfield, but was regained by Smit.
Howard Stern's U.S. Open Sores was an event that occurred at the Nassau Coliseum, Uniondale, New York in front of a sold-out attendance of 16,000.
Montgomery also holds the South African record for "Test points" with 893, which at the time of his international retirement placed him sixth on the all-time list of Test point scorers (he now stands ninth).
Taking place on October 7, 1989, the main event featured a tennis match between Howard Stern and his radio show producer Gary Dell'Abate.
Steyn also holds the Springbok record for the "fastest 100 points" (8 Test matches)
The event sold out in four hours, with each ticket costing $22.50.
Although statistics on the success rate of kicks at goal were not kept until the late 1980s, it is believed that Steyn also holds the record for "most consecutive successful kicks at goal in Tests".
Other suggested event titles included "The Bush Open", "U.S. Open Legs", "U.S. Open Beaver" and "U.S. Beaver Open".
He had a streak of 41 successful kicks at goal, which started during the Boks' Test against Italy on 19 June 2010 and ended on 6 November 2010 against Ireland.
The event was later released on VHS via mail order.
John Smit was the "world's most-capped captain", having has captained South Africa in 82 of his 110 Tests.
A documentary crew shot behind-the-scenes footage including interviews with participants and guests creating a 105-minute program.
He has since been overtaken by Richie McCaw and Brian O'Driscoll.
Butt Bongo Fiesta is a VHS of a special hosted by Howard Stern.
The "world's most-capped lock pairing" is that of Victor Matfield and Bakkies Botha, who have started together in 62 Tests.
Released in late 1992, the tape features "Jungle Man," a segment filmed for 3-D viewing, with each original tape being supplied with two 3-D viewing glasses.
Smit also played 46 "consecutive matches" for South Africa, which is a record.
The Miss Howard Stern New Year's Eve Pageant (later released as Howard Stern's New Year's Rotten Eve 1994; a send off to "Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve") was a two-hour pay-per-view special that aired on New Year's Eve 1993 and New Year's Day 1994, hosted by Howard Stern.
The record "try scorer" is Bryan Habana with 67 international tries.
Included in the special were parodies of Michael Jackson and Jerry Seinfeld, a song by Gary Dell'Abate (Stern's radio show Executive Producer) called "Doing the Baba Booey," and a mock beauty pageant resulting in the crowning of the show's first "Miss Howard Stern."
Fly-half Jannie de Beer holds the "world record for dropped goals in a Test match" (5, during the 44–21 quarter-final win over England in the 1999 Rugby World Cup)
Judges for the pageant included Janis Ian, Daniel Carver, John Bobbitt, Sherman Hemsley, Mark Hamill, Tiny Tim and Joe Frazier.
The "most points" Montgomery ever scored in a "single international" was 35 against Namibia in 2007—this is also a South African record.
More than 40 women (and one man) participated in the pageant, most of whom were winners from preliminary contests held in cities where the radio show was being syndicated at the time.
On 1 August during the 2009 Tri Nations tournament, Morné Steyn set a number of records during the second Test between the Springboks and the All Blacks.
The field, which was narrowed down to 20, competed in the lingerie and talent rounds.
The Springboks won 31–19, with Steyn scoring all South Africa's points – 1 try, 1 conversion, 8 penalties.
Five finalists were announced and after an interview round, the runners-up and winner were announced.
Eleven former South African international players have been inducted into either the International Rugby Hall of Fame or the IRB Hall of Fame.
During the pageant, there were many sentiments made among the contestants about favoritism given to certain girls, notably Debbie Tay, because they were hand-picked by Stern on his radio show, therefore given more attention and exposure.
Barry "Fairy" Heatlie, who played in the late 19th century and into the early 20th, was one of the early greats of South African rugby.
The special was available for order on VHS videotape, and came packaged with a limited edition Leroy Neiman lithograph of Howard.
He appeared for Western Province 34 times between 1890 and 1904, with 28 of them being Currie Cup wins.
"Private Parts: The Album" is the title for the film's soundtrack.
He also played six Tests for South Africa against the Lions in 1891, 1896, and 1903, and also captained the side to their only two Test wins of the 1890s.
Released on February 25, 1997, the 29-track album features two that Stern himself provides lyrics, performing with Rob Zombie and The Dust Brothers.
Arguably his greatest legacy to South African rugby is the green jersey; he is credited with introducing the colour for South Africa's 1903 Test against the Lions at Newlands.
In-between each song there is a sequence from the movie (just like on a real radio program).
He was inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame in 2009.
In 1997, the album was certified platinum for shipping 1,000,000 copies.
Bennie Osler played 17 consecutive Tests between 1924 and 1933.
When this year’s round of unsuspecting Northerners fail to show up for their annual Guts N’ Glory Jubilee because the Feds are investigating the disappearances of Northerners over the years, the residents of Pleasant Valley take their twisted carnival on the road and head to Iowa, where they encounter spoiled heiresses, Rome and Tina Sheraton, and the cast and crew of their “Road Rascals” reality show.
Playing at fly-half, his first Test was against the touring British team in 1924.
They begin killing the cast and crew.
He also played in the series against the All Blacks in 1928, but most notably captained the Springboks on their Grand Slam tour of 1931–32 when they defeated all four Home Nations.
At the end, the residents of Pleasant Valley get an idea to use a TV commercial to lure in their victims.
His last Tests were the five played against Australia when they toured to South Africa in 1933.
Unlike the first film Raw Nerve was not involved with the production.
Osler was inducted to the International Rugby Hall of Fame in 2007 and the IRB Hall of Fame in 2009.
On October 21, 2009 "2001 Maniacs: The Beverly Hellbillys" was retitled to "2001 Maniacs: Field of Screams" announced Tim Sullivan in Santa Monica, California a short time before to movie start on American Film Market.
Making his Test debut in Olser's Grand Slam winning team in 1931 was scrum-half Danie Craven.
The finished film was unveiled at 2010's FRIGHT FEST in Glasgow, Scotland on February 26 and three other film festivals in the UK.
Craven played several positions including fly-half, scrum-half, centre and even number-eight.
The DVD release in the United Kingdom is set with the July 5, 2010.
However Craven was most famous for popularising the dive pass.
The domestic Blu-ray release, with the unrated version is set for the July 20, 2010.
As well as winning a Grand Slam with Osler's team, Craven toured with 1937 Springboks to New Zealand where they achieved their first series victory over New Zealand.
The film had his US premiere on April 29, 2010 as part of the Texas Frightmare Weekend and is acquired by First Look Studios.
His last act as player was captaining South Africa in a Test series against the Lions.
The West Coast release is set for the July 17, 2010.
Craven's involvement with the Springboks continued after his playing retirement, and he coached them to a 4–0 series win over the touring All Blacks in 1949.
The New Jersey release on July 17, 2010 was hosted by Tim Sullivan.
He was elected President of the South African Rugby Board in 1956, a position he held until the post-apartheid South African Rugby Union was formed in 1991.
"Mayor Buckman" actor Bill Moseley had a duet with Rani Sharone as Spider Mountain on the soundtrack.
Such was Craven's influence in South African rugby he became known as "Mr Rugby", was inducted into the International Hall of Fame in 1997, and was in the second class of inductees into the IRB Hall of Fame in 2007; behind Rugby School and William Webb Ellis.
Scott Weinberg of Fearnet called it "a merciless chore to get through."
The man most credited with inventing modern number 8 play was Hennie Muller, inducted into the International Hall of Fame in 2001.
R. L. Shaffer of IGN rated it 3/10 stars and called it derivative and dull.
He played 13 Tests between 1949 and 1953, and in the process won a 4–0 series victory over the All Blacks and a Grand Slam tour of Britain and Ireland.
David Harley of Bloody Disgusting rated it 0.5/5 stars and described it as "a film which makes absolutely no sense, has no real plot, and is peppered with jokes that seem to be going for being merely crude and offensive rather than funny."
He was nicknamed "Windhond" (greyhound) for his speed around the field.
Scopula ternata, the smoky wave, is a moth of the family Geometridae.
When writing about the 1949 series against the All Blacks, Harding and Williams wrote: "(Okey) Geffin won the series, perhaps, but Muller made it possible."
It was described by Schrank in 1802.
Of Muller's 13 Tests, he only lost one—against Australia in 1953.
It is mainly found in Northern and parts of Central Europe and in isolated populations in Southern and South-Eastern Europe.
Named South Africa's player of the 20th Century in 2000, Frik du Preez played 38 Tests between 1961 and 1971.
Its western range is Eastern France, Eastern Belgium and Scotland, with an isolated population in the Pyrenees.
Du Preez could play both flanker or lock and was one of the most dominant forwards of the 1960s, but was especially well known for his all round skills.
In the North its range extends to the polar regions and in the South it is found up to the Alps.
Danie Craven said of du Preez, "To my mind he could have played any position on a rugby field with equal brilliance."
Its Eastern range extends through Central and North Russia up to the Ural, through Siberia up to the Yenisei River.
He was inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame in 1997 and the IRB Hall of Fame in 2009.
The wingspan is for males and for females.
Morne du Plessis played 22 Tests for South Africa between 1971 and 1980.
The moth flies from May to July in the warmer regions and from June to August in Northern Europe.
He went on to captain South Africa and became part of the only father-son pair to captain South Africa—his father had captained South Africa in 1949.
The larva preferably feeds on "Vaccinium myrtillus", "Vaccinium uliginosum", "Calluna vulgaris", "Lathyrus niger", "Salix repens" and "Erica".
He led South Africa to a 3–1 series win over the All Blacks in 1976 and a series win over the British and Irish Lions in 1980 by the same margin.
Less frequent, they have also been recorded on "Lonicera tatarica", "Stellaria", "Polygonum aviculare", "Fragaria vesca", "Lactuca sativa" and "Taraxacum officinale".
Du Plessis would be inducted into the International Hall of Fame in 1999.
Archer is an American adult animated sitcom created by Adam Reed for the basic cable network FX.
International Hall of Fame inductees Naas Botha, inducted in 2005, and Danie Gerber, inducted in 2007, both had careers interrupted by South Africa's sporting isolation in the 1980s and early 1990s.
It follows the exploits of a dysfunctional group of secret agents—Sterling Archer (voiced by H. Jon Benjamin) and seven of his colleagues—Malory Archer (Jessica Walter), Lana Kane (Aisha Tyler), Cheryl Tunt (Judy Greer), Pam Poovey (Amber Nash), Ray Gillette (Adam Reed), Cyril Figgis (Chris Parnell) and Dr. Algernop Krieger (Lucky Yates).
Playing at fly-half, Botha played 28 Tests and scored 312 Test points before his international retirement in 1992.
The premise of "Archer" evolves in subsequent seasons as the show experiments with the standard setup of an anthology, each with self-contained arcs, new settings, a disparate set of personae for each character, even distinct humor.
Botha contributed significantly to the Springboks 1980 series win over the Lions, and also played for the World XV in the IRB Centenary Match at Twickenham.
Beginning with the eighth season in 2017, the series moved to the FXX network.
Gerber also made his debut in 1980, and scored 19 tries in his 24 Tests before retiring in 1992.
"Archer" was conceived by Reed shortly after the cancellation of his Adult Swim comedy "Frisky Dingo".
He scored a hat-trick against England in 1984, and played alongside Botha in the World XV team in 1986.
It draws inspiration from a variety of sources, including the "James Bond" franchise.
In South Africa's first Test since the fall of apartheid, against the All Blacks in 1992, he scored twice.
The show's hallmarks include reference-heavy humor, rapid-fire dialogue, and meta-comedy.
Two players that straddled the amateur and professional eras were Francois Pienaar and Joost van der Westhuizen.
"Archer" is produced using limited animation and takes its visual style from mid-century comic art.
Both first played for the Springboks in 1993.
The cast members record their lines individually, and the show regularly employs guest actors and actresses for supporting characters.
Pienaar was named captain in his first Test against France, and went on to captain the side to the 1995 World Cup.
There have been 101 episodes broadcast in the show's history.
It was there he captained South Africa to the World Cup title, and received the trophy from Nelson Mandela who was wearing his number 6 jersey.
"Archer" has received positive reviews from critics and won awards, including three Primetime Emmy Awards and four Critics Choice Awards.
Nelson Mandela later wrote "It was under Francois Pienaar's inspiring leadership that rugby became the pride of the entire country.
The series has also received 15 Annie Award nominations, among others, for outstanding achievement in animation, writing, direction, and voice acting.
Francois brought the nation together."
At San Diego Comic-Con 2018, it was announced the tenth season will be titled "Archer: 1999".
Pienaar entered the International Hall of Fame in 2005, and was inducted into the IRB Hall in 2011 alongside all other World Cup-winning captains from the inaugural event in 1987 through 2007 (minus the previously inducted Australian John Eales).
Reed intends to leave "Archer" after its tenth season, although plans have not yet been finalized for the show's future.
Joost van der Westhuizen also participated in the 1995 World cup victory, but went on to play in two more World Cups.
"Archer" follows the exploits of eight dysfunctional secret agents of the International Secret Intelligence Service (ISIS), a fictional New York-based intelligence agency.
Playing at scrum-half, van der Westhuizen played 89 Tests for South Africa and scored 38 tries.
They are Sterling Archer, the show's narcissistic, womanizing protagonist; Malory Archer, the retired agent-turned-ISIS director and Sterling's snarky, emotionally distant mother; Lana Kane, Sterling's love interest and mother of his infant daughter, and by far the most professional field agent at ISIS; Ray Gillette, the agency's openly gay bomb specialist; Pam Poovey, the head of the agency's Human Resources department who is often ridiculed by her peers; Cyril Figgis, a mild-mannered accountant-turned-agent; Cheryl Tunt, Malory's delusional, psychotic personal assistant; and Dr. Algernop Krieger, a bizarre, morally bankrupt scientist with little regard for the well-being of his subjects.
At the time of his retirement following the 2003 World Cup he was South Africa's leading try scorer and most capped player.
The show features an array of supporting characters, several of whom gained expanded roles in subsequent episodes.
He entered the International Hall of Fame two years after Pienaar, in 2007.
Major supporting roles in "Archer" include Slater, an arms dealer and agent for the CIA; Katya Kazanova, head of the KGB and Sterling's former love interest; and Barry Dylan, Sterling's archnemesis, who vows to kill him.
The newest Springbok player to enter the IRB Hall is John Smit, inducted in 2011 alongside Pienaar.
Early seasons of "Archer" take place in an anachronistic, Cold War-esque universe—the exact period is intentionally vague.
The captain of the 2007 World Cup winners, Smit (as noted earlier) ended his international career as the most-capped Springbok in history.
This, according to art director Neal Holman, allowed producers the freedom to "cherry pick the stuff [they] like and ignore the elements that [they] don't."
The 2009 Silver Helmet (BK) is the 2009 version of Bronze Helmet organized by the Polish Motor Union (PZM).
Yet in "Archer" subsequent years, Reed developed new settings and character arcs, often with self-contained stories, as he explored new concepts for the comedy, much like an anthology.
The Final took place on 11 September in Wrocław and was won by Maciej Janowski (Atlas Wrocław).
These seasons see the group attempt to complete a number of laborious tasks in highly unusual circumstances, generally to no avail, that involve sustaining an illegal cocaine operation to keep afloat, contract work for the CIA, and running a private, Los Angeles-based detective agency after being blacklisted from espionage by the US government.
Janowski beat Patryk Dudek (Falubaz Zielona Góra) and Łukasz Sówka (KM Lazur Ostrów Wlkp.)
The show's eighth season, "Archer Dreamland", transpires in Sterling's subconscious, re-imagining the core cast as stock characters from a Gangland-era noir film set in 1947 Los Angeles.
Gonville & Caius College (often referred to simply as Caius ) is a constituent college of the University of Cambridge in Cambridge, England.
The ninth season, "", continues this arc as the characters are again re-envisioned as inhabitants of a remote South Pacific island circa 1939.
The college has been attended by many students who have gone on to significant accomplishment, including fourteen Nobel Prize winners, the second-most of any Oxbridge college (after Trinity College, Cambridge).
The tenth season will be set in Archer's subconscious version of space.
The college has long historical associations with medical teaching, especially due to its alumni physicians: John Caius (who gave the college the caduceus in its insignia) and William Harvey.
According to Reed, it will be a "1970s vision of the future" with nods to the "prevalent aesthetic at the time", featuring "floppy disks instead of holograms", and "xenomorphs" of some description.
Other famous alumni in the sciences include Francis Crick (joint discoverer, along with James Watson, of the structure of DNA), James Chadwick (discoverer of the neutron) and Howard Florey (developer of penicillin).
The cable television network Comedy Central has exclusive US broadcast syndication rights for "Archer".
The college also maintains reputable academic programmes in many other disciplines, including law, economics, English literature and history.
The terms of the deal cover the show's existing content and a commitment for future seasons.
Gonville & Caius is said to own or have rights to much of the land in Cambridge.
Comedy Central began airing the series on their network on March 2, 2015, in one-hour program time slots.
Several streets in the city, such as Harvey Road, Glisson Road and Gresham Road, are named after alumni of the College.
In the United Kingdom, Viceland owns exclusive cable syndication rights for "Archer"s first five seasons.
The college and its masters have been influential in the development of the university, founding other colleges like Trinity Hall and Darwin College and providing land on the Sidgwick Site, e.g. for the Squire Law Library.
In Canada, the show is syndicated nationally on Teletoon at Night, and new episodes are aired in tandem with the American broadcast.
The college was first founded, as "Gonville Hall", by Edmund Gonville, Rector of Terrington St Clement in Norfolk in 1348, making it the fourth-oldest surviving college.
In 2014, Amazon Prime and Hulu purchased online streaming rights to "Archer" as part of multiyear licensing agreements with 20th Television.
When Gonville died three years later, he left a struggling institution with almost no money.
Beginning in 2018, Hulu retains exclusive streaming rights to the show under a new licensing agreement with 20th Century Fox.
The executor of his will, William Bateman, Bishop of Norwich, stepped in, transferring the college to its current location.
Before the creation of "Archer", Adam Reed worked on animated comedies with executive producer and longtime collaborator Matt Thompson.
He leased himself the land close to the river to set up his own college, Trinity Hall, and renamed Gonville Hall "The Hall of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary".
The pair became renowned for their work on a number of Adult Swim television projects, chiefly "Sealab 2021" and their follow-up "Frisky Dingo", which aired for several years.
Bateman appointed as the first Master of the new college his former chaplain John Colton, later Archbishop of Armagh.
After the cancellation of "Frisky Dingo" in 2008, Reed took a vacation to Spain to brainstorm ideas for a new project.
By the sixteenth century, the college had fallen into disrepair, and in 1557 it was refounded by Royal Charter as "Gonville & Caius College" by the physician John Caius.
His experience traversing the Vía de la Plata, and people watching in Plaza Mayor in nearby Salamanca, enabled him to conceptualize his vision of "Archer".
He provided the college with significant funds and greatly extended the buildings.
Reed recalled in an interview, "So I sat on the Plaza Mayor for three days—drinking either coffee or beer or gin, depending on the time of day—surrounded by these Spanish women who seemed both unaware and completely aware of their beauty.
During his time as Master, Caius accepted no payment but insisted on several unusual rules.
Occasionally they would glance over—and catch me gaping at them—and just smile at me like, 'I know, right?'
He insisted that the college admit no scholar who “is deformed, dumb, blind, lame, maimed, mutilated, a Welshman, or suffering from any grave or contagious illness, or an invalid, that is sick in a serious measure”.
And for three days, I couldn't even splutter "Buenos dias" to any of them—not once.
Caius also built a three-sided court, Caius Court, “lest the air from being confined within a narrow space should become foul”.
And thus was Sterling Archer born—he would've absolutely sauntered over to a table full of those women and sat down and ordered an entire case of cava or whatever."
Caius did, however, found the college as a strong centre for the study of medicine, a tradition that it aims to keep to this day.
Nevertheless, he believed developing a sitcom with the theme of global espionage was inevitable given his proclivity for adventure-driven comedy.
By 1630, the college had expanded greatly, having around 25 fellows and 150 students, but numbers fell over the next century, only returning to the 1630 level in the early nineteenth century.
The "James Bond" franchise, "" (2006), and "The Pink Panther" franchise were Reed's inspiration as the series, then under the working title "Duchess", began taking definite form.
Since then the college has grown considerably and now has one of the largest undergraduate populations in the university.
By August 18, 2009, following Reed's pitch to FX, the network commissioned six episodes for "Archer".
The college first admitted women as fellows and students in 1979.
FX initially commissioned the project as a companion series for their situational comedy "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia", but the network ultimately delayed "Archer" premiere to the following January because of the demanding production schedule, and "The League" became "Philadelphia" companion show instead.
The first buildings to be erected on the college’s current site date from 1353 when Bateman built Gonville Court.
Despite this, the pilot, "Mole Hunt", aired as a test screening on September 17, 2009, following the season five premiere of "Philadelphia".
The college chapel was added in 1393 with the Old Hall (used until recently as a library) and Master’s Lodge following in the next half century.
The pilot was not featured in program listings or otherwise promoted by FX; rather the network merely informed select television critics of the broadcast.
Most of the stone used to build the college came from Ramsey Abbey near Ramsey, Cambridgeshire.
FX moved "Archer" to FXX's broadcast lineup in 2017 as part of an aggressive strategy to increase the network's output of animated programming.
Gonville and Caius has the oldest purpose-built college chapel in either Oxford or Cambridge which has been in continuous use as such.
FX had planned the move before the show's seventh season, in conjunction with the debut of "Cassius and Clay", but decided against it after "Clay" abrupt cancellation.
The chapel is situated centrally within the college, reflecting the college's religious foundation.
The ninth season premiered on April 25, 2018.
On the re-foundation by Caius, the college was expanded and updated.
Reed intends to conclude "Archer" after its tenth season, although plans have not yet been finalized according to a 2018 interview with IndieWire.
In 1565 the building of Caius Court began, and Caius planted an avenue of trees in what is now known as Tree Court.
Scriptwriting an episode consumes three weeks of the production schedule.
He was also responsible for the building of the college's three gates, symbolising the path of academic life.
As the comedy's main writer, Reed typically creates the first draft during pre-production, which he submits to his team of producers and art directors.
On matriculation, one arrives at the Gate of Humility (near the Porters' Lodge).
From there, they analyze the script for each character, cast guest stars, and create basic concept designs, before Reed develops a final script to submit to FXX.
In the centre of the college one passes through the Gate of Virtue regularly.
A typical "Archer" episode goes through a page of dialogue per minute.
And finally, graduating students pass through the Gate of Honour on their way to the neighbouring Senate House to receive their degrees.
"Archer" uses the standard setup of a workplace comedy, where "subversively unlikeable" characters play off bawdy, reference-heavy humor, rapid-fire dialogue, and interaction-based drama.
The students of Gonville and Caius commonly refer to the fourth gate in the college, between Tree Court and Gonville Court, which also gives access to some lavatories, as the Gate of Necessity.
Early episodes parody spy film and routinely mock cliches of the genre.
The buildings of Gonville Court were given classical facades in the 1750s, and the Old Library and the Hall were designed by Anthony Salvin in 1854.
By the end of the fourth season, however, Reed questioned the longevity of the comedy's spy premise and began contemplating a new direction for "Archer", partly inspired by the then-growing associations of ISIS with the identically initialled fundamentalist Salafi jihadist group.
On the wall of the Hall hangs a college flag which in 1912 was flown at the South Pole by Cambridge's Edward Adrian Wilson during the famous Terra Nova Expedition of 1910–1913.
Newer seasons experiment with the standard format of an anthology, each with their own self-contained arc, new settings, a disparate set of personae for each character, even distinct humor.
Gonville Court, though remodelled in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, is the oldest part of the college.
Reed said, "Once we started making them, and having a good time making them, [we thought] 'what are some other things we can do now that the boundaries have sort of been passed?'"
New lecture rooms were designed by Alfred Waterhouse and completed by Rattee and Kett in 1884.
Cultural references on "Archer" cover a wide spectrum of society and the human condition, in film, literature and music for example.
It is so named because John Caius planted an avenue of trees there.
Some—chiefly references to literature—are obscure, and the audience often may not notice them in a single viewing.
Although none of the original trees survive, the court retains a number of trees and the tree-lined avenue, which is unusual for a Cambridge front court.
Reed cites his time as a university English major as the primary forebear for the show's literary references.
Caius owns a substantial amount of land between West Road and Sidgwick Avenue.
"Archer" also develops a unique self-referentiality through character-based jokes, catchphrases, and running gags that evolve over multiple episodes.
Set in landscaped gardens, the modern Harvey Court (named after William Harvey and designed by Leslie Martin) was built on the West Road site in 1961.
For example, Sterling or another character may yell "phrasing" in response to any sexually suggestive remark.
Adjacent to Harvey Court is the Stephen Hawking Building, which opened its doors to first-year undergraduates in October 2006.
Neil Genzlinger of "The New York Times" argues that "Archer" uses "a caustic brand of humor that isn't for everybody but that has brought the show a dedicated fan base."
Providing ensuite accommodation for 75 students and eight fellows, as well as providing conference facilities in the vacations, the Stephen Hawking Building boasts some of the highest-standard student accommodation in Cambridge.
"Archer" animation style mirrors the aesthetic of "Mad Men" and mid-century comic art in the style of Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, among others.
Additional buildings provide housing for older students, a day care, and various study and music rooms.
Line work is pronounced by thick, bold outlines, in contrast to the very fine, thin line work characteristic of prime time comedies such as "The Simpsons" and "Family Guy".
The college also owns extensive gardens and the land on which the adjacent Squire Law Library has stood since 1995.
Production of the comedy involves a workforce of 150 crew members from Reed and Thompson's Atlanta-based company Floyd County Productions, quadrupling the number that worked on its freshman season.
Caius also has one of the largest libraries in Oxbridge, housed in the Cockerell Building.
"Archer"s production process uses Adobe software—Photoshop, Illustrator, and After Effects—as well as visual effects programs such as Toon Boom Harmony and Cinema 4D for compositing and animation.
Caius acquired the lease on the building, which previously housed the Seeley History Library and the Squire Law Library, in the 1990s.
This begins via storyboarding, typically after a script has been approved, and lasts around 11–13 weeks per episode.
The college library was relocated there from Gonville Court in the summer of 1996, following an extensive renovation.
Four episodes are produced in tandem at any given session, generally in staggered phases.
These courts are across Trinity Street on land surrounding St Michael's Church.
In the initial stages of animation, art director Chad Hurd and producer Neal Holman storyboard set pieces with a team of artists based on specifications in the script.
St Michael's Court was completed only in the 1930s, with the building on its south side of a new building overlooking the Market Place.
After a series of design revisions and reviews, these skeletal designs are then rendered as 3D models in Autodesk 3ds Max, employing a variety of animation and special effects techniques.
The college also owns several houses around Cambridge, on Mortimer Road and Gresham Road, where some second year undergraduates live, and on Harvey Road and St Paul's Road, which are occupied by graduate students.
The illustration team takes various screenshots of the 3D models once they have been completed, and the resulting images are enhanced by specialized artists in After Effects.
The Fellows' garden lies just beyond Harvey Court, on Sidgwick Avenue.
The characters are composed in Illustrator using referential material, among them photos of models and actors in costume.
The extensive sports fields are located on Barton Road, a few minute's walk from Harvey Court.
Because "Archer" is produced using limited animation, characters are rendered as digital puppets, and not hand-drawn on paper and digitally composited for traditional cel animation.
Caius Boat Club is the college's boat club, with the men's 1st VIII remaining unbeaten in the seasons of 2010/11 and of 2011/2012.
Costumes may or may not be reproduced depending on their animatability; too much detail can hurt a character's animatability.
Caius Jazz takes place most terms in the college bar, inviting 'some of the most illustrious names in the contemporary scene' and a house band of students studying at London conservatoires to play in the college bar.
These body pieces are then separated into basic components and layers, much like an action figure, and rigged in After Effects.
In recent years Steve Fishwick, Sam Mayne, Ian Shaw, Barry Green, Gareth Lockrane, and Paul Jarvis have all been featured.
Consequently, one given pose can turn into a range of others, which, according to producer Bryan Fordney, creates "the illusion of more animation on screen than what is actually present."
The Caius May Ball is an all-night party in June, held every two years.
A similar technique is used in the animation of a character's face—head illustrations are divided into basic components that can be turned "off" and "on" in sequence, lending the appearance of facial movement and expression.
The choir was founded by the composer Charles Wood in the late nineteenth century, and is currently directed by the scholar of South-American choral music, Geoffrey Webber.
Source code is often implemented to ensure better automation and a more fluid range of motion.
The choir tours abroad and records eclectically.
Once compositing begins, compositors enhance the visual palette of artwork from three or four departments until it "looks like it was made by a single artist."
"You All Dat " is a song recorded by the Bahamian group, Baha Men.
For elaborate scenes like action sequences, artists develop several composites, which are then superimposed on stock footage using special effects.
It featured guest vocals from American vocalist Imani Coppola.
Holman cited "Catch Me If You Can" (2002), "The Incredibles" (2004), "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" (2006), and the work of Saul Bass as strong stylistic influences in the creation of "Archer" title sequence.
Originally on 2 Zero 0-0, It was released in January 2001 as the second and final single from their album, "Who Let the Dogs Out".
When he was developing the original sequence, the rough draft version consisted of style frames with roiling flame silhouettes of the characters coalesced on a charred, black background.
It reached the top 10 in Australia and reached the top 20 in the United Kingdom.
The crew initially struggled to develop an opening theme they believed was compatible with the premise of "Archer", but once the show's eponymous theme song had been completed, Holman felt his idea was too melodramatic and went in a different direction.
The song, which samples "The Lion Sleeps Tonight", is about a man trying to seduce a woman at a party.
He created the finalized version of the sequence from several segments, each reviewed by the producers, because of the demanding production schedule.
A "clean" edit changes the line "You gotta have balls or you ain't gonna get none" to "You gotta be bold or you ain't gonna get none."
The standard opening of "Archer" has gone through six iterations—a replacement of shots at the start of the show's sixth season, and brand new sequences for its fifth, seventh, eighth and ninth seasons.
The song was featured in season 2, episode 15 ("The Grandparents") of "Malcolm in the Middle".
"Archer" did not employ a composer to develop a soundtrack in its first four seasons, but instead used a compilation of needle drop stock music.
It was also included on the show's soundtrack, "Music from Malcolm in the Middle", released in 2000.
By season five, musician JG Thirlwell was hired as the composer for the comedy's jazz-influenced score, brought to the producers' attention for his work on "The Venture Bros.".
The Oracle of the Lamb is an ancient Egyptian prophetic text written on a papyrus in Demotic Egyptian and dated to the thirty-third year of the reign of the Roman Emperor Augustus (r. 27 BC – 14 AD).
"Archer" has a principal cast of eight actors: H. Jon Benjamin, Jessica Walter, Aisha Tyler, Judy Greer, Amber Nash, Chris Parnell, Lucky Yates, and Adam Reed.
In it, a lamb speaks and provides prophecies to a man named Pasenhor.
Benjamin voices the show's titular character, Walter voices Malory Archer, Tyler plays Lana Kane, Greer portrays Cheryl Tunt, Nash plays Pam Poovey, Parnell voices Cyril Figgis, Yates portrays Dr. Algernop Krieger, and Reed plays Ray Gillette.
The lamb describes a world turned upside-down and reduced to chaos: temples are in disarray, the ruler has now become the ruled, and the Medes (i.e. referring to the Persian domination of Egypt) have come to destroy Egypt.
Reed was expected to play the titular role in the original pilot, but was recast because producers felt his voice-over did not serve the character's dialogue well.
It also mentions that the Greeks (i.e. referring to the Ptolemaic domination of Egypt) will take the White Crown (representing pharaonic Upper Egypt).
When Benjamin received the offer, he was surprised since he did not believe his voice was suitable for the part.
London: Golden House Publications, printed and bound by T.J. International.
At one point, Benjamin used a British accent for the character, but Reed insisted he use his normal speaking voice.
Diop Kamau (born Don Jackson, March 16, 1958) is an American civil rights activist who investigates and works to resolve instances of police misconduct, neglect, or abuse.
Walter was the first significant casting choice on "Archer".
In 1994 he founded policeabuse.com, and is also its CEO.
Producers contracted her shortly after they sent out character descriptions to talent agencies, and they promoted her involvement to recruit actors for the project.
Don Jackson is an African American civil rights activist and investigative journalist who has pioneered groundbreaking investigations into two of the nation's most pernicious dimensions of policing: bias-based profiling and the widespread refusal by the police to properly document serious allegations of abuse and egregious misconduct.
Greer agreed to "Archer" because of her wish to break into voice acting, although she initially believed the series was too provocative for network TV.
Jackson was born on March 16, 1958, at BonAir hospital in South Central Los Angeles.
Nash did not audition for her part, rather the actress was approached by Reed and Thompson, whom she had previously collaborated with in "Frisky Dingo", while she was recording DVD extras for their program.
He is the fourth child of Margie Faye Woods, a nurse, and Woodrow Jackson, one of the first African Americans to join the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Office.
Yates was brought onto "Archer" at Nash's request, after Krieger was given a more prominent speaking role.
Woodrow and Margie raised Don along with his five siblings in a neighborhood of manicured lawns and middle-class homes in Compton, California.
In addition to the main cast, episodes often feature guest voices from a range of professions.
Don remembers his father rushing out of their home in the midst of the Watts rebllion in 1965 to join other police officers attempting to control the violence.
Major supporting roles in "Archer" are played by George Coe (until his death in 2015), Jeffrey Tambor, Christian Slater, Jon Hamm, Allison Tolman, Dave Willis, Ona Grauer, Keegan-Michael Key, Bryan Cranston, and J.K. Simmons, among others.
Jackson grew up in an environment where hard work was rewarded, and education was encouraged.
Some stars appear as themselves, or portray fictionalized caricatures of themselves, such as Slater, Kenny Loggins, as well as the late Anthony Bourdain and Burt Reynolds.
He attended Birmingham high school where he excelled in sports, serving as captain of both his high school football and wrestling team.
"Archer" cast members record their lines individually rather than at group recording sessions to accommodate their work schedules.
He went on to California Lutheran College on an athletic scholarship, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice.
The producers therefore do not host table reads or rehearsals.
After college Jackson joined the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office.
Reed or another producer may be present at a session, or direct actors over the phone in the event they are not together.
His time there was punctuated by tests of his character and physical stamina.
Recording sessions can take place anywhere, but are typically held at studios in Atlanta, Los Angeles, and New York, depending on the actor's home base.
Despite the Ventura County police academy’s record of washing out black recruits, Jackson graduated from the academy and later transferred to the Hawthorne Police Department where he would hone his skills as an elite undercover investigator.
"Archer" has been well received by the media.
Jackson rose through the ranks quickly at Hawthorne as he sponsored several daring undercover operations.
A number of TV critics have complimented the work of the voice actors, often singling out Benjamin for further praise: Tim Goodman from "The Hollywood Reporter", for example, viewed Benjamin's acting as the bedrock of "Archer", "mixing rants, mumbling, whining and a stop-and-start delivery style that is note-perfect for comedy."
Jackson was taught by his parents that when you are African American you must often be twice as good as your competitors.
Other reviewers cited the writing, the crude sensibility, and characterization among the show's most satisfying attributes: the main characters have been described as "exceedingly well-defined."
With that in mind, he earned the top score on three consecutive promotional exams to become the youngest sergeant on the force.
Chris Barton of the "Los Angeles Times" called "Archer" "the smartest, strangest animated show on TV this side of "Rick and Morty"," and "Entertainment Weekly" journalist Ken Tucker praised the series for its "solid plotting, vividly distinct characters, and some of the most unexpected punchlines and sight-gags in prime time."
But as his career flourished, Jackson became frustrated with the routine brutality and frequent racism displayed amongst his peers.
"Archer" willingness to experiment with anthologized tropes is a principal topic of discussion among critics.
Jackson rebelled against his brothers in blue, first by filing complaints about misconduct directed against minority citizens, and later by going public with a complaint of racism at the Hawthorne Police Department.
Some journalists felt these arcs provide the show greater creative license to explore deeper within itself.
As Jackson’s battle with the Hawthorne PD spilled into the media, his father Woodrow Jackson, who was near retirement, was stopped by a group of Pomona California police officers.
While the comedy received positive feedback for staying true to form "in the service of something much grimier and at once totally fresh" in early seasons, later "Archer" episodes have been subjected to criticism as the tone and emphasis of the show evolves.
The officers identified the elder Jackson as a potential robbery suspect.
By the eighth and ninth seasons, some critics believed that despite having greater visual appeal, "Archer" too often sacrifices narrative continuity and humor through increasingly predictable and uninspired writing.
He was taken from his car and brutally attacked.
The series has been included on a number of best of lists.
A midnight phone call between Jackson and his dad would change the course of Jackson’s life: After learning of the brutality his father suffered, Don decided to take on the police in a one-man war against abusive cops.
"TV Guide" ranked "Archer" among the 60 greatest TV cartoons of all time, and the show placed within the top ten on "Entertainment Weekly" 25 Greatest Animated TV Series.
He used cutting edge computer technology to document police misconduct in 5000 investigations in over 100 cities, often accompanied by a rotating list of volunteers and undercover investigators willing to put their lives on the line to test the police.
Similarly, "The New Yorker", in a non-ranked rundown of 2014's most noteworthy programs, called "Archer" "good counter-programming for every horrible thing in the news."
News organizations became aware of Jackson’s efforts and often went in-tow.
"Archer" success allowed the ensemble to embark on a nationwide tour, "Archer Live!"
Jackson’s most well-known such investigation was the 1989 test of the Long Beach, California Police Department.
, where the actors performed scenes from the show's repertoire.
While testing profiling among officers for a news broadcast, Jackson was beaten, thrown into a plate glass window, and arrested.
The tour commenced with shows in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Philadelphia, and New York—sporadic dates were later added to the itinerary.
As is often the case in hundreds of similar incidents, the officers falsified their arrest report.
Live readings may also be held at promotional events such as the San Diego Comic-Con International.
However, unlike the many hundreds of police-citizen interactions which are not filmed, this one was captured on video.
FX released "Cherlene (Songs from the Series Archer)", a compilation of country music, on March 3, 2014, through digital media.
The video recording of Jackson’s arrest exploded on national television and resonated in a way that other stories about police misconduct failed to.
The album features a cover of "Danger Zone", with guest vocals by Kenny Loggins, as well as three original tracks composed by Aaron Lee Tasjan.
The videotaped arrest and the obviously false police report of the incident gave police critics a formidable weapon.
Kevn Kinney, frontman of Drivin N Cryin, led music production of "Cherlene".
Congresswoman Maxine Waters, along with others, rallied to Jackson’s support and called for hearings and investigations.
Kinney had met Adam Reed a decade earlier, and was hired after a lunch meeting with the writer and Matt Thompson in Atlanta.
In 1992, the California State Assembly held hearings and Jackson was called to testify.
In preparation for his services, Kinney viewed "Archer" first three seasons to familiarize himself with Cheryl Tunt—the eponymous character of "Cherlene".
The hearings resulted in a new law, which increased penalties for false reports to a felony and added requirements for all officers in the state of California to receive racial sensitivity training.
The album was recorded at Griffin Mastering, Inc. with a group that included Tasjan, David Franklin, and Drivin N Cryin member Dave V. Johnson on instrumentation.
Though a new law had been passed, Jackson was not satisfied.
Jessy Lynn Martens provided Cheryl's singing voice, chosen because of her subdued Southern accent and likeness to Judy Greer's voice.
Jackson’s one-man war on the cops would change in 1991 when he met the love of his life, actress Tyra Ferrell, at a Hollywood party.
"Cherlene" received positive reviews and peaked at number 68 on iTunes' best-selling albums chart.
Ferrell was hanging out with friends at a house party when she and Jackson shared a glance.
In June 2016, Thompson and executive producer Casey Willis discussed the possibility of a feature-length "Archer" film with "The Daily Beast".
It was love at first sight and the two would become inseparable a year later when they married.
According to Thompson, this discussion happens "once every two years" among Reed and the producers, although work on the project would likely not begin until after the show ends.
The marriage ceremony was consecrated on the deathbed of Jackson’s mother Margie who was in the final stages of breast cancer.
As well, they cited Jon Hamm as their ideal choice of actor to portray Sterling if it's commissioned as a live-action adaptation.
Her final joy was watching her son take his vows of marriage with a woman she adored.
Karen Burke (born 14 July 1971) is an English footballer.
If anyone thought the marriage would slow down Jackson’s work, it had just the opposite effect.
She most recently played for Blackburn Rovers Ladies.
Ferrell, an A-list African American actress who had just completed the trailblazing film Boyz in the Hood, joined Jackson to support his cause.
Burke was born in Liverpool and represented England at full international level.
They left Southern California together in 1992, driving and camping out on a Goldwing motorcycle for their honeymoon.
Burke only took up football aged 21, with a spell at St. Helens.
With Ferrell’s support, Jackson purchased the most sophisticated recording equipment available and went on a tear across the country producing eight Emmy and Edward R Morrow award-winning investigations into police misconduct and racial profiling.
In 1994 she reached her first FA Women's Cup final with Knowsley United.
The investigations forced policy changes, police firings, and thousands of hours of retraining for officers stemming from the high-profile exposes Jackson produced with local and national media.
Burke hit the crossbar in injury–time as Knowsley lost 1–0 to Doncaster Belles.
Jackson traveled the country with his wife, daughter, and a 40-foot RV hauled by a Ford F350 pick-up truck loaded with hi-tech investigative equipment.
In the following year's final, with Knowsley now known as Liverpool Ladies, player–of–the–match Burke twice put them ahead against Arsenal, only for Marieanne Spacey to seal a 3–2 win for The Gunners.
As Jackson hit the streets, Tyra Ferrell stood by his side guiding his investigations.
In summer 1995 Burke agreed to join Everton Ladies, but changed her mind when Liverpool appointed John Bennison — a professional coach from the Liverpool F.C. "Boot Room".
Many times, Ferrell was up all-night waiting by the phone to make sure Jackson got home safe.
In April 1996 Burke lost her third consecutive FA Women's Cup final to Croydon, on penalties after a 1–1 draw at The New Den.
In 1994, Jackson and Ferrell started Policeabuse.com to provide a safe place for citizens to report complaints.
Luckless Burke had given Liverpool the lead and converted her penalty in the shoot–out.
Over 25 years, the website has processed more than 20,000 complaints for citizens free of charge.
She finally joined Everton Ladies in the 1997 close season and won the Premier League title in 1997–1998.
Through the website Ferrell and Jackson have pioneered hundreds of investigations resulting in prosecutions of police officers, policy changes, and settlements for indigent victims.
She played in Iceland in summer 1998, 1999 and 2000, with ÍBV.
Today their work stands alone as the only national hidden camera testing of police complaint intake procedures and racial profiling ever done.
In 2000 Burke and team–mate Becky Easton joined Doncaster Belles.
Their work is a 600 video YouTube archive of investigations on behalf of police misconduct victims.Many police agencies have made policy changes as a direct result of Jackson’s hidden camera investigations.
Burke would travel twice weekly to Doncaster from her base in Liverpool, where she worked in a pub.
Jackson and Ferrell’s videotapes and training materials have been utilized to educate both officers and citizens alike.
The 2002 FA Women's Cup Final was Burke's fourth unsuccessful appearance, as Doncaster were beaten 2–1 by the full–time professionals of Fulham.
In 1994, as a political statement, Jackson changed his name to Diop Kamau (Quiet Soldier) to acknowledge his daughter’s birth.
Burke moved to Leeds United Ladies for 2002–2003 before spending the 2003 close season back with Icelandic side ÍBV.
24 years later Jackson returned to his birth name Don Jackson, as a tribute to his father Woodrow Jackson, the best cop he had ever known .
She returned to Doncaster Belles for 2003–2004, before joining an exodus of players brought about by a cash–crisis and moving back to Leeds, via another stint at ÍBV.
He was born in Los Angeles, California.
Burke then suffered more FA Women's Cup final disappointment with Leeds United Ladies, in their 5–0 defeat against Arsenal in 2006.
Beyond Reach is the sixth novel in the Grant County series by Karin Slaughter, originally published in 2007 .
Burke left Leeds to join Blackburn Rovers Ladies in the 2007 close season.
The previous books in the series are "Blindsighted, Kisscut, A Faint Cold Fear, Indelible", and "Faithless".
Although signed as an attacking midfielder, she moved to right–back for the 2009–10 season.
"Beyond Reach" was released in European market with the title Skin Privilege.
Burke has won over 50 caps for the England senior team.
The books feature characters Sara Linton, Jeffrey Tolliver, and Lena Adams.
The Economic Intelligence Council is the apex forum overseeing government agencies responsible for economic intelligence and combating economic offences in India.
In this book, a main character of the series is impacted in a serious way, which resulted in much controversy and commentary on the event -- including spoilers being posted in online book review venues.
The Council is also the apex of 18 regional economic intelligence committees, and is part of the Union Ministry of Finance.
Slaughter has written a note to her readers about her decision, which is posted on her website.
It was formed in 1990.
The Heartsdale Children's Clinic is closed.
The Economic Intelligence Council is responsible for coordination, strategy and information-sharing amongst the government agencies responsible for intelligence and control of economic offences such as smuggling, money laundering tax evasion and fraud.
Sara spends all day being deposed in a malpractice lawsuit filed by the parents of Jimmy Powell, now dead from leukemia, and a deep-pockets-picking lawyer, over a ridiculous technicality.
The Council also advises the Finance Minister and the Union Council of Ministers on laws regulating the financial sector and fighting economic crimes.
Everything she's built up for the last 16 years is crumbling away as greedy townspeople line up to get in on the action, not realizing their betrayal of her is only going to result in higher healthcare costs for everyone or that the nearest pediatrician is 100 miles away.
The chairperson of the Economic Intelligence Council is the Finance Minister of India.
Sara's parents are gone on a cross-country RV trip and her sister is counseling the homeless in Atlanta, only old/new husband Jeffrey is there for support.
Its chief members include the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and the Directors of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence.
When he's called away to the town of Reese, it's almost a relief to get to go with him...except that they're going because Lena lies in a hospital with smoke inhalation, under arrest and suspected of being involved in murder.
Members from the Finance Ministry include the Secretaries of Finance, Revenue, Company Affairs and the Additional Secretary of Banking.
She was found beaten badly, watching a torched SUV burn with a body inside it, on the 50-yard line of the high school football field, foot propped on an empty gas can.
The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs is represented by its chairman and its members responsible for the Excise/GST, Customs and Anti-Smuggling departments.
And she won't say a word to anyone.
Such as the Directors Of Directorate of GST Intelligence (DGGI) and Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI).
Reese is Lena's home town, and she came back to check on her Uncle Hank, the ex-addict who raised her and her twin sister.
The Central Board of Direct Taxes is represented by its chairman and the member for investigation.
She found him mixed up with some very unsavory characters and hooked on drugs again after being clean for three decades.
Other department heads include the Directors of the Directorate General of Economic Enforcement.
And major events from her past are now in question, events that shaped who she is.
Under the Economic Intelligence Council are 30Regional Economic Intelligence Committee (India).
One of the few things of which she is certain is that Jeffrey and Sara are in terrible danger, and she must stop at nothing to get them out of town.
The committees are constituted of a wide range of agencies and officials responsible for the designated regions.
Vazhapadi Ramamurthy (died 27 October 2002) was an Indian politician from Tamil Nadu.
The Xiaohe (Little River) Cemetery , also known as Ördek’s Necropolis, refers to a bronze-age burial site located near the dried out Lop Nur Lake, in Xinjiang, Western China.
He served as Union Minister of Petroleum as part of NDA government under Atal Behari Vajpayee.
It is an oblong sand dune, from which more than 30 well-preserved mummies, buried in air-tight ox-hide bags, have been excavated.
Ramamurthy came to politics through the Dravidar Kazhagam (DK) founded by the late Periyar E. V. Ramasamy.
The mummies, the earliest of which date from around 4000 years ago, appear Caucasoid.
He belonged to the Vanniyar community.,
Genetic analysis, however, revealed an admixture of population from both the West and East, with paternal lineages being exclusively west Eurasian, and maternal lineages - a mixture of east and west Eurasian.
He served as the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president.
The entire Xiaohe Tomb complex contains about 330 tombs, about 160 of which have been looted by grave robbers.
In 1989 he was appointed as the President, Pradesh Congress Committee (Indira), Tamil Nadu by Rajiv Gandhi.
The Xiaohe remains contains the largest number of mummies found at any single site in the world to date.
Ramamurthy was elected as a member of the Lok Sabha six times and was defeated twice, in 1996 and 1999.
No human settlement has been found near the tomb complex; the bodies were therefore likely to have been transported from elsewhere for burial at this site.
He was involved with the International Labour Organisation and served as minister of state for Labour with independent charge in the Congress government led by P. V. Narasimha Rao for a brief period in 1991.
A local hunter named Ördek found the site around 1910.
He quit his ministerial post on the Cauvery issue.
Later, in 1934, partly with Ördek's help, Swedish explorer and archeologist Folke Bergman located the site which he named Ördek’s Necropolis.
He was president of the TNCC for six years before being replaced in 1996 when he formed the Tamil Nadu unit of the Tiwari Congress.
The tomb complex appeared as a small oval mound, and the top of the burial mound was covered with a forest of erect wooden posts whose tops had been splintered by strong winds.
Ramamurthy went back to the Congress but left that party again to form Tamizhaga Rajiv Congress (TRC).
Oar-shaped wooden monuments and wooden human figures were found at the site.
In January 2002 he merged TRC with the congress after a break of about eight years.
The coffins were assembled over the bodies which had become mummified.
He was Member of Parliament elected from Tamil Nadu.
Bergman excavated 12 burials and recovered approximately 200 artifacts that were transported back to Stockholm.
He was elected to the Lok Sabha as an Indian National Congress candidate from Dharmapuri constituency in 1977 election and from Krishnagiri constituency in 1984, 1989 and 1991 elections.
Bergman noted the surprising resemblance in the clothing, especially the fringed loin-cloths, to Bronze Age grave finds in Denmark, but dismissed any direct connection.
He was elected from Krishnagiri constituency as an Indian National Congress (Indira) candidate in 1980 election.
In October 2003, an excavation project, organized by the Xinjiang Cultural Relics and Archaeology Institute, began at the site.
He was elected from Salem constituency as an Independent candidate in 1998 election.
A total of 167 tombs have been uncovered since the end of 2002, and excavations have revealed hundreds of smaller tombs built in layers.
Ramamurthy died in Chennai on 27 October 2002.
In 2006, a coffin wrapped with ox hide in the shape of a boat was found.
The Prime Minister of India, Atal Behari Vajpayee, said Ramamurthy had worked hard throughout his life towards ameliorating the condition of the working class and that he had made significant contributions to the trade union movement and other nation-building activities.
It contained a remarkably intact mummy of a young woman, which came to be called the Beauty of Xiaohe.
The Congress president, Sonia Gandhi, remembered Ramamurthy as a stalwart of Tamil Nadu politics.
Each tomb is marked by a vertical poplar post near the upper end of the coffin.
In her message to the bereaved family, she said the Congress had lost a valued and respected leader.
A skull or horn of an ox may be suspended from the post.
Birra Korça is a brewing company, founded in Korçë, Albania, in 1928.
The ends of the posts can be either torpedo-shaped or oar-shaped, representing the phallus and vulva respectively.
Birra Korça is the first beer brewed in Albania.
The male burials were marked with the oar-shaped posts, while the female burials were marked with the phallic posts.
The brewery was established in the town of Korçë, Albania, in 1928.
Bows and arrows were found with the male burials.
It was founded by an Italian investor Umberto Umberti and Selim Mboria a local investor.
The posts and coffins may be painted red.
It produced Blonde Ale Beer, Dark ale, bottled water “Kristal” and ice.
Each coffin is made of two massive pieces of plank assembled over the body, resembling an overturned boat, and then covered with cowhides.
After the end of World War II and with the establishment of the communist regime in Albania on January 11, 1946, the brewery became property of the Albanian State, according to the laws of the time.
A few special tombs containing females have an extra rectangular coffin on top covered with layers of mud.
Several reconstructions and renovations were done in the years 1955, 1957 and 1965 and the production was gradually increased.
Small masks of human faces and wooden human figures may accompany the burials.
In April 1994 following the change in the political climate, as well as economic downturn, political and social unrest, followed by the liberalization of the market, in Albania the brewery was sold in auction and was bought by a group of businessmen.
Twigs and branches of ephedra were placed beside the body.
In 2004 the brewery was bought by the businessman Irfan Hysenbelliu the president of “Birra Korça LLC”.
In years 2009–2015, the remains of in total 92 individuals found at the Xiaohe Tomb complex were analyzed for Y-DNA and mtDNA markers.
Soon after this a 15 million euro (€) investment was made to renovate and renew the factory.
Genetic analyses of the mummies showed that the maternal lineages of the Xiaohe people originated from both East Asia and West Eurasia, whereas the paternal lineages all originated from West Eurasia.
Since then the brewery has undergone a deep technological and architectural reconstruction.
Mitochondrial DNA analysis, which reveals the maternal ancestry, showed that maternal lineages carried by the Xiaohe people included West Eurasian haplogroups H, K, U5, U7, U2e, T and R*; East Asian haplogroups B5, D and G2a; haplogroups of most likely Central Asian or Siberian origin C4 and C5; as well as typically South Asian haplogroups M5 and M*.
The traditional design has been preserved by adding new elements of the same style.
On the other hand, nearly all (11 out of 12 - or around 92%) of surveyed paternal lines were of West Eurasian haplogroup R1a1, and one was of exceptionally rare basal paragroup K*.
Using the latest Czech and Italian technology it brews 120,000 hectoliters of beer annually, ten times the output of the old brewery.
The geographic location of this admixing is unknown, although south Siberia is likely.
The water comes from natural springs of Morava Mountain.
According to a comment posted on 18 July 2014 by Hui Zhou, one of study's co-authors, Xiaohe R1a1 lineages belonged to a specifically European branch rather than the more common Central Asian R-Z93.
Birra Korca holds an annual beerfest during the month of August which is the biggest in the region.
Richard Hurlin (born 14 January 1984 in Cardiff) is a Welsh footballer, who plays for Peninsula Power Football Club.
Beers under the Korça brand include: Blonde Ale, European type pilsner 4.8-5% abv and Dark Ale a 5-5.2% abv Euro dark lager (dunkel).
He started his career with Cardiff City FC as a youth player but would later sign for his home town team Llanelli AFC in the summer of 2001.
Birra Korça is sold in bottles 0.5 lit and 0.33 lit also in kegs 30 lit and 50 lit.
After impressing in his first season in the Welsh Premier League he signed for title chasers Cwmbran Town AFC in the 2003 January transfer window where he would spend the next three seasons.
“Birra Korça” holds several quality awards.
During his time at Cwmbran, Richard attracted interest from a number of football league clubs and after an unsuccessful trial at Nottingham Forest F.C. he spent 3 months with Swansea City A.F.C. where he was on the verge of signing until Manager Nick Cusack was released from his coaching position and the deal fell through.
First award was taken in Thessaloniki, Greece in the year 1928.
Richard would stay with Cwmbran until March 2005, during which time he enjoyed great success with the club, one which gave him the opportunity to play against Israel giants Maccabi Haifa in the UEFA cup 1st qualifying stage, losing 6-0 on aggregate.
In 2007 in London, the company received the International Quality Crown Award in Golden category from Business Initiative Directions (BID), a vanity award.
His time at Cwmbran also saw him score the fastest ever goal for the club, after just 18 seconds he drove the ball past Caersws's goalkeeper from the edge of the box.
Birra Korça is a holder of ISO 22000 certificate which is an international standard intended to be used by organizations within the food chain.
This cementing him into Cwmbran's history books.
It contains traditional quality assurance preventive measures plus preventive food-safety measures.
In March 2005 Richard left Cwmbran Town to pursue a football career in the US where he was awarded a four-year soccer scholarship at Savannah College of Art and Design.
In 2009 in Frankfurt, German again Birra Korça was awarded with the International Arch of Europe Award in Diamond Category.
While at college in the US he achieved All Region, All Conference and All American honors in his first 3 seasons and broke two college records in doing so.
This prize was handed over to Mr. Kasem Hysenbelli (the representative of Birra Korça) from, Mr. Prieto.
On 12 March 2012 signed for Australian side Peninsula Power Football Club and played on 18 March his Debut against Capalaba Football Club in the Brisbane Premier League.
Birra Korça has widespread distribution in Albania and is exported to a number of neighboring countries.
During his time at Cwmbran, Richard also picked up a succession of international caps for the Welsh U19's team after impressing manager Neville Southall in an international friendly against Norway he was chosen to play in the Milk Cup against Paraguay, Northern Ireland and Scotland and would also serve his country in the European U19 championship playing against Hungary, Andorra and Ireland.
In 2011 Birra Korca entered the American market and can be purchased at various locations in Massachusetts.
Neville Southall once described Richard as being 'the first ever £1million unattached player' whilst on international duty.

Emotions is Thelma Aoyama's second studio album, and her third album overall.
It models protein-ligand docking using the CHARMM program.
The album was released on September 9, 2009.
The project was retired on May 23, 2014.
Two singles have been released from this album, " and ".
It was first described by American mycologist Murrill in 1917.
"Kono Mama Zutto" was not included in this album.

The 1987 Rugby World Cup Final was the final match in the 1987 Rugby World Cup, the first Rugby World Cup played.
"Emotions" debuted at No. 9 on the Oricon Daily Chart on its first day.
It was played at Eden Park in Auckland, New Zealand on 20 June 1987 between the hosts New Zealand and France.
The Seven Lamps of Architecture is an extended essay, first published in May 1849 and written by the English art critic and theorist John Ruskin.
New Zealand won the match 29–9 with three tries, one conversion, four penalties and a drop goal, becoming the first winners of the Rugby World Cup.
The 'lamps' of the title are Ruskin's principles of architecture, which he later enlarged upon in the three-volume "The Stones of Venice".
In front of a capacity crowd at Eden Park, hosts New Zealand met France in the inaugural Rugby World Cup Final .
To an extent, they codified some of the contemporary thinking behind the Gothic Revival.
France seemed lacklustre following their amazing win over Australia in the semi-final .
At the time of its publication A. W. N. Pugin and others had already advanced the ideas of the Revival and it was well under way in practice.
New Zealand played a mainly kicking game in the first half with Grant Fox kicking for territory and position .
Ruskin offered little new to the debate, but the book helped to capture and summarise the thoughts of the movement.
A Fox drop goal after 14 minutes settled home nerves .
"The Seven Lamps" also proved a great popular success, and received the approval of the ecclesiologists typified by the Cambridge Camden Society, who criticised in their publication "The Ecclesiologist" lapses committed by modern architects in ecclesiastical commissions.
A try by the World Cup's star performer Michael Jones, followed just 3 minutes later .
The essay was published in book form in May 1849 and is structured with eight chapters; an introduction and one chapter for each of the seven 'Lamps', which represent the demands that good architecture must meet, expressed as directions in which the association of ideas may take the observer:
Jones' try was converted by Fox, a tense final was finely balanced at half time with New Zealand leading France 9–0 .
Writing within the essentially British tradition of the associational values that inform aesthetic appreciation, Ruskin argued from a moral stance with polemic tone, that the technical innovations of architecture since the Renaissance and particularly the Industrial Revolution, had subsumed its spiritual content and sapped its vitality.
France came out with renewed vigour after the break and a Didier Camberabero penalty four minutes into the half put France on the scoreboard .
He also argued that no new style was needed to redress this problem, as the appropriate styles already existed.
Tries by David Kirk and John Kirwan together with the relentlessly accurate goal kicking of Fox meant that going into the final moments New Zealand led 29–3 .
The 'truest' architecture was therefore, the older Gothic of medieval cathedrals and Venice.
A final surge near the whistle led to a France try through Pierre Berbizier .
The essay sketched out the principles which Ruskin later expounded upon in the three-volume "The Stones of Venice" published between 1851 and 1853.
The try was converted as the last kick of the game by Didier Camberabero .
Practically, he suggested an 'honest' architecture with no veneers, finishes, hidden support nor machined mouldings and that beauty must be derived from nature and crafted by man.
The final had hardly lived up to its billing, probably due to the exertions by France in their semi-final win.
Ruskin drew upon Archibald Alison's "Essays on the Nature and Principles of Taste" (1790–1810) for some of his principles, such as the requirement of leisured poise as the best state for appreciating beauty, the thought that the natural countryside is more conducive to producing an artist than the city, that the glory of architecture lies in its age.
It was however fitting that tries from three stars of the tournament Jones, Kirk and Kirwan won the contest and gave New Zealand the Webb Ellis Cup.
"The Seven Lamps" was reduced to the status of a "moral gloss on Alison" by George L. Hersey, in "High Victorian Gothic".
This taxon has been divided into five genera including "Podomonas", "Manchomonas", and "Multimonas".
He had an abiding confidence in the natural, untutored instinct for rightness and beauty in the average person: "all men have sense of what is right in this matter, if they would only use and apply this sense; every man knows where and how beauty gives him pleasure, if he would only ask for it when he does so, and not allow it to be forced upon him when he does not want it."
Several species have been described including:
This contrasts with the thread of modernism that holds that people must be "taught to appreciate" good design.
The genera "Apusomonas" and "Manchomonas" appear to be closely related but the branching order of the other genera has yet to be established.
Another contrast with modernism is in the aesthetic of functionality: Ruskin saw no beauty in well-designed tools: beauty is out of place where there is not serene leisure, or "if you thrust it into the places of toil.
Darkworld Detective is a collection of science fantasy stories written by J. Michael Reaves, published as a paperback original by Bantam Books in 1982.
Put it in the drawing-room, not into the workshop; put it on domestic furniture, not upon tools of handicraft."
The linked stories feature protagonist, a detective on the planet Ja-Lur.
For Ruskin, Beauty was not an inherent characteristic but a thing that could be applied to an object or withheld from it.
An authorized sequel, "The Black Hole of Carcosa", was written by John Shirley and published by Pocket Books in 1988.
By 1849, A. W. N. Pugin and others had already advanced the ideas of the Gothic Revival and its popularity was secured.
Writing in "F&SF", John Clute described the volume as "dim but decent," faulting Reaves's narrative style as "about as close to Raymond Chandler as Kai Lung is to Confucius" but concluding that the stories are nevertheless "mostly straightforward fun."
Ruskin offered little new to the debate, but the book helped to capture and summarise the thoughts of the movement, proved a great popular success, and received the approval of "The ecclesiologists", the influential newsletter of architectural criticism published by the Cambridge Camden Society.
Jozef Štafura (born 11 September 1948 in Pavlovce nad Uhom, Czechoslovakia) is a former Slovak football midfielder who played for Strážske and mostly for VSS Košice (1969–80).
Effects such as the polychromy of High Victorian Gothic architecture may be traced to him, in a genre of "Ruskinian Gothic" that was practised in Britain and colonies like New Zealand and Canada, and in Anglophile strata of the United States.
He played overall 251 games and scored 26 goals during his ten seasons at the Czechoslovak First League.
Ruskin had made his debut as a critic of architecture with "The Poetry of Architecture" (1839), an essay in the picturesque that he later rejected, "The Seven Lamps" were still tentative steps for Ruskin's architectural criticism and offered a moral creed for architects.
He was a part of the legendary VSS midfield from the 1970s, including trio Štafura – Daňko – Pollák.
He later went on to disclaim the essay as a 'wretched rant'.
On 2 May 1973, Štafura made his only appearance for the Czechoslovakia national football team in a 1–1 away draw against Denmark at the 1974 FIFA World Cup qualification.
The first effect of the book was almost immediate in the influence it had upon William Butterfield's All Saints, Margaret Street Church.
Bodkin was born in Queenstown in 1883.
Politician Alexander Beresford Hope and architect Butterfield had agreed upon the general details just a month after Ruskin's book was published and by August they had revised their plans to encapsulate the principles it espoused.
He represented the rural Otago electorate of Otago Central from to 1954, when he retired.
All Saints is considered the first Ruskinian building due to its use of brick 'honestly' employed as a structural system rather than for surface decoration.
In 1935, he was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal.
Ruskin's writings became a significant influence on William Morris and the Arts and Crafts Movement in the latter half of the 19th century.
He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1954.
In the United States, Ralph Waldo Emerson's expectations of a new, authentic American style had prepared the ground: Ruskin's "Seven Lamps" were quickly assimilated into the aesthetics of Transcendentalism.
In 1955, Bodkin was granted the use of the title of "Honourable" for life, having served more than three years as a member of the Executive Council.
In 1899 Marcel Proust read a translation of Ruskin's chapter "The Lamp of Memory" in a Belgian magazine.
The marshal is in charge of serving warrants issued by the City Court of Lafayette.
He projected the transforming experience onto the narrator of "Du côté de chez Swann", who describes himself as a boy reading the piece in the garden at Combray.
In December 2014, former deputy marshal Brian Pope was elected to the office of city marshal, succeeding long-time incumbent Earl "Nickey" Picard, who had held the position of Lafayette city marshal since 1984.
Later Proust, who translated some works of Ruskin, claimed to know "The Seven Lamps of Architecture" by heart.
In October 2018, Brian Pope was later convicted of several felony charges and removed from office.
"Seven Lamps of Architecture" and other of Ruskin's writings on architecture are summarized and extensively quoted in John Unrau, "Looking at Architecture with Ruskin" (Toronto: University of Toronto), 1978.
Former Marshal Pope still faces 7 additional felony charges with more charges pending.
Writing in the preface to the first edition Ruskin remarks;
He retired in 1988 to become Emeritus Professor at the University of York, where he continued to research.
Every apology is, however, due to the reader for the hasty and imperfect execution of the plates.
His awards included one for Distinguished Contributions to Psychophysiology (U.S., Society for Psychophysiological Research, 1987), the Zubin Award for Distinguished Contributions to the Discipline from the Society for Research in Psychopathology (U.S., 1990), Honorary Membership of the Experimental Psychology Society (U.K., 1993), an award from the British Association for Cognitive Neuroscience for Outstanding Contributions to British Psychophysiology (UK, 2009), and most recently the Lifetime Achievement Award for Distinguished Contributions to Psychological Knowledge (British Psychological Society, 2014).
Having much more serious work in hand, and desiring merely to render them illustrative of my meaning, I have sometimes very completely failed even of that humble aim; and the text, being generally written before the illustration was completed, sometimes naively describes as sublime or beautiful features which the plates represents by a blot.
Venables published over 260 journal articles, book chapters, and books.
I shall be grateful if the reader will in such cases refer the expressions of praise to the Architecture, and not to the illustrations.
Three of his articles have been recognized as citation classics.
The following illustrations are from the third edition where the situation had been much improved.
His contributions in the fields of schizophrenia and psychophysiology embraced a wide range of topics that included clinical, cognitive, neuroanatomical, psychophysiological, and neurodevelopmental issues.
Qatar–Russia relations  refers to bilateral foreign relations between the two countries, Qatar and Russia.
Kosmos 268 (meaning "Cosmos 268"), known before launch as DS-P1-Yu No.18, was a Soviet satellite which was used as a radar calibration target for tests of anti-ballistic missiles.
Following Saudi Arabia's lead, Qatar refused for many years to have diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.
It was a spacecraft, which was built by the Yuzhnoye Design Bureau, and launched in 1969 as part of the Dnepropetrovsk Sputnik programme.
This changed in the summer of 1988, when diplomatic relations between the two states were established on 2 August.
Kosmos 268 was launched from Site 86/4 at Kapustin Yar, atop a Kosmos-2I 63SM carrier rocket.
The Soviet Union opened its embassy in Doha on 12 November 1989, and Qatar opened its embassy in Moscow on 14 November 1989.
The launch occurred on 5 March 1969 at 13:04:55 UTC, and resulted in Kosmos 268's successful deployment into low Earth orbit.
On 26 December 1991, Qatar recognised the Russian Federation as the successor state to the Soviet Union, after the latter's dissolution.
Upon reaching orbit, it was assigned its Kosmos designation, and received the International Designator 1969-020A.
Russia has an embassy in Doha, and Qatar has an embassy in Moscow.
Kosmos 268 was operated in an orbit with a perigee of , an apogee of , 48.4 degrees of inclination, and an orbital period of 108 minutes.
The current Ambassador of Russia to Qatar is Andrey Vladimirovich Andreyev, who was appointed by President Vladimir Putin on 17 July 2005.
It remained in orbit until it decayed and reentered the atmosphere on 9 May 1970.
The current Ambassador of Qatar to Russia is Ahmed Saif Al-Midhadi, who appointed his Letters of Credence to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on 27 February 2009.
It was the nineteenth of seventy nine DS-P1-Yu satellites to be launched, and the eighteenth of seventy two to successfully reach orbit.
Relations became strained after Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev was assassinated in Qatar on 13 February 2004.
The stadium holds 3,206 spectators.
On the third anniversary of Yandarbiyev's death, Russian President Vladimir Putin traveled to Qatar on a state visit, where he was received by Emir of Qatar Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani.
The 1960 Daytona 500 was a NASCAR Grand National Series (now Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series) stock car race that was held on February 14, 1960, at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida, United States.
On November 29, 2011, Russian Ambassador to Qatar, Vladimir Titorenko, was allegedly assaulted by Qatar airport security and customs officers when he refused to have his suitcase scanned at the airport.
The race featured 200 laps on the asphalt tri-oval, and was won by Junior Johnson.
Relations again became strained on February 7, 2012, when reportedly, after a diplomat from Qatar warned Russia of losing the support of Arab League about upcoming resolution on the Syrian uprising, which Russia and China later vetoed, the answer came harsh from Russian ambassador Vitaly Churkin who replied that "If you talk to me like that, there will be no Qatar today" and boasted about Russian military superiority over Qatar.
Gasoline from the Pure Oil brand was offered to each qualifying driver free of charge prior to the race.
Later, Russia denied all these accusations.
Even during these times, the fuel sponsor was stressing the importance of safety around flammable liquids by not allowing drivers to smoke while their vehicles were being refueled.
Russian and Qatar gas producers agree to develop oil refineries in Yamal Peninsula along with halal reindeer meat.
Elmo Langley's vehicle was notable seen around the race track at all times; with its mechanical work fine-tuned by owner/mechanic Ratus Walters.
12 Feb 2007 in Doha in the framework of the official program of the visit to Qatar of the President of Russian Federation Vladimir Putin signed an Agreement to establish a Russian-Qatari Business Council.
The race was won by Junior Johnson driving a 1959 Chevrolet owned by John Masoni.
Chairman of the Russian-Qatari business Council is a Russian businessman Akhmet Palankoev.
Johnson drove the number 27 to victory in just over four hours after starting in the 9th position.
Nuria Pomares is a dancer.
Bud Burdick, Pappy Crane, Dick Foley, Dick Freeman, Tommy Herbert, Dave Hirschfield, Bob Kosiski, Shep Langdon and Bill Lutz would retire from NASCAR after this event.
She was born in Madrid and studied Spanish and Classical ballet at the Royal High School of Dance.
In late January 1960 the CBS network sent anchorman Bud Palmer and other employees to Daytona to cover the events in the first ever televised coverage of a NASCAR event.
Her professional debut was at Lincoln Center in 1991.
Johnson took the lead with nine laps remaining when Bobby Johns spun, and Johnson went on to win the race.
She has danced at the Teatro de la Zarzuela in Madrid and the Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona.
It was also known as being the slowest Daytona 500 race in history.
She was a soloist with Jose Antonio y los Ballets Españoles for one year and danced with Joaquín Cortés in "Pasión Gitana" for 4 years.
In the largest crash in racing history, 37 cars crashed in Turn 4; the worst injuries sustained were minor cuts and bruises.
Since 2002, she has danced in the opera "La vida breve" by Manuel de Falla under the direction of Rafael Frühbeck de Burgos throughout the United States and Europe, including with the New York Philharmonic, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra, and the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra.
Race winner Junior Johnson went on to achieve multiple accolades in the following years; including being inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1990 and being selected as one of NASCAR's 50 Top drivers in 1998.
Nuria Pomares directs her own school of dance, which she founded in 1983.
On February 4, 2010 NASCAR announced that Johnson would be Grand Marshal for the 50th anniversary of his 1960 victory.
She has danced in the Washington National Opera, Plácido Domingo (2009) in From my latin soul.
Part of Johnson's duties as Grand Marshal would be to utter the immortal words "Gentleman, start your engines" at the 52nd running of the Daytona 500 on February 14, 2010.
She is special guest israel philharmonic orchestra in Annual Gala 75th season (2010) the opera Carmen under the direction of Zubin Mehta.
The race lasted 4:00:30, with an average speed of 124.74 mph.
High-level verification (HLV), or electronic system-level (ESL) verification, is the task to verify ESL designs at high abstraction level, i.e., it is the task to verify a model that represents hardware above register-transfer level (RTL) abstract level.
The following is a list of characters who have appeared on the USA Network series "Royal Pains".
For high-level synthesis (HLS or C synthesis), HLV is to HLS as functional verification is to logic synthesis.
Dr. Henry "Hank" Lawson (Mark Feuerstein): A successful New York ER doctor soon to be married to his lovely fiancée, he was dismissed from his job because he triaged a dying teenager before a billionaire hospital benefactor.
Electronic digital hardware design has evolved from low level abstraction at gate level to register transfer level (RTL), the abstraction level above RTL is commonly called high-level, ESL, or behavioral/algorithmic level.
The benefactor dies, after being initially stabilized following a femoral artery catheterization, from causes attributed to pericardial tamponade.
In high-level synthesis, behavioral/algorithmic designs in ANSI C/C++/SystemC code is synthesized to RTL, which is then synthesized into gate level through logic synthesis.
Hank stands up for himself by stating he saved the kid.
Functional verification is the task to make sure a design at RTL or gate level conforms to a specification.
He spends the next month in a tailspin of broken engagements and unpaid bills before his brother convinces him to attend a posh party in the Hamptons.
As logic synthesis matures, most functional verification is done at the higher abstraction, i.e. at RTL level, the correctness of logic synthesis tool in the translating process from RTL description to gate netlist is a less concern today.
At the party, he saves supermodel April, and wins the favor of the German nobleman, Boris.
High-level synthesis is still an emerging technology, so High-level verification today has two important areas under development
This leads to referrals to other rich clientele.
The tetraploid complementation assay is a technique in biology in which cells of two mammalian embryos are combined to form a new embryo.
Despite Hank's dislike of the upper class, a potential love interest in local hospital administrator Jill Casey convinces him to become a concierge doctor.
It is used to construct genetically modified organisms, to study the consequences of certain mutations on embryonal development, and in the study of pluripotent stem cells.
He drives a well-aged Saab 900 Turbo convertible.
Normal mammalian somatic cells are diploid: each chromosome (and thus every gene) is present in duplicate (excluding genes from X chromosome absent in Y chromosome).
He is originally from New Jersey and sometimes throws a Jerseyism into his speech.
The assay starts with producing a "tetraploid" cell in which every chromosome exists fourfold.
In the episode "Keeping the Faith", he mentions that he is Jewish.
This is done by taking an embryo at the two-cell stage and fusing the two cells by applying an electrical current.
In the episode "Business and Pleasure", Hank mentions that he graduated from Northwestern University and Mount Sinai School of Medicine.
The resulting tetraploid cell will continue to divide, and all daughter cells will also be tetraploid.
In the third season finale, Hank and Evan have split, with Hank leaving HankMed and Evan hiring Dr. Van Dyke to replace him.
Such a tetraploid embryo can develop normally to the blastocyst stage and will implant in the wall of the uterus.
Hank rejoins HankMed in the middle of the fourth season.
The tetraploid cells can form the extra-embryonic tissue (placenta etc.), however a proper fetus will rarely develop.
In the fourth season finale, Hank has a major accident and knocks his head, needing surgery.
In the tetraploid complementation assay, one now combines such a tetraploid embryo (either at the morula or blastocyst stage) with normal diploid embryonic stem cells (ES) from a different organism.
In the fifth season, Hank is still recovering from his surgery and becomes dependent on pain medication that he gets Jeremiah to prescribe.
The embryo will then develop normally; the fetus is exclusively derived from the ES cell, while the extra-embryonic tissues are exclusively derived from the tetraploid cells.
In the season finale, Hank takes Boris' job offer to travel with him and his family and be their personal doctor.
A nitrilium ion is a nitrile that has been protonated, [RCNH], or alkylated, [RCNR′].
In the series finale, Hank again receives an offer by Boris to travel with him and his family and be their personal doctor.
Nitriles are only weakly basic and are poor nucleophiles, but they will attack very reactive electrophiles such as carbocations.
Hank declines, choosing instead to travel to Africa and re-unite with Jill.
Nitrilium salts can be prepared by reacting nitriles with trialkyloxonium salts.
Three years later, during the Memorial Day holiday, he and Jill, now married, return to the Hamptons to be with Evan, Paige and their family and continue with HankMed.
The nitrilium ions thus formed can then be reduced to secondary amines with sodium borohydride in diglyme.
He is an accountant (CPA), makes himself Hank's CFO after he establishes "HankMed" as well as the unofficial Public Relations Manager.
This is a convenient route to secondary amines of the form RCH—NH—R′.
He views the Hamptons as a place to pursue attractive women, especially Divya, who continually rebuffs him.
Nitrilium ions are believed to be intermediates in the hydrolysis of nitriles, the Beckmann rearrangement, the Friedel-Crafts cyclization of amines to isoquinolines, the Schmidt reaction with ketones, and the Ugi, Ritter, Pinner and Passerini reactions.
He is materialistic, especially in comparison to Hank and when promised money and fun, he is up to do anything.
The Soap Myth is a play by American playwright Jeff Cohen.
He tries to promote HankMed against Hank's will, and many of his subplots revolve around him engaging in some scheme (against Hank's wishes) that ends up going wrong.
Information about the play can be found at http://www.burkecohenent.com/439032480.
When Hank is given a Tesla all-electric roadster by "New Parts" Newberg and her dog Koufax, Hank in turn gives it to Evan (who later, to help out HankMed's struggling finances, sells it).
The play had a workshop run in July 2009 at the "Dog Run Repertory Company," and a rewritten version had an Off-Broadway run in the Spring of 2012 Off Broadway at The Roundabout Theater's Harold and Mimi Steinberg Theatre Center.
While many of his intentions (if not his motives) are good, he originally doesn't seem to realize the consequences of some of his actions; for example, in episode 12, "Wonderland", Evan invests all the capital from HankMed into a con stock company investment with a broker who turns out to be his and Hank's father.
That production was filmed and the film was broadcast nationally on PBS and can be viewed at digitaltheatre.com.
When this goes disastrously wrong, he leaves the Hamptons, informing his brother that he is going to try to get the money back.
The cast was Greg Mullavey, Andi Potamkin, Dee Pelletier and Donald Corren under the direction of Arnold Mittlelman.
Evan is a womanizer (unsuccessfully most of the time), but it is often hinted that he is attracted to Divya, as he continues to make passes at her despite her rather harsh rebuffs.
On May 2, 2016, "The Soap Myth" was presented as a reading at the Bruno Walter Auditorium at the Lincoln Center Library for the Performing Arts.
She kisses him passionately in episode 10, "Am I Blue?"
The reading, directed by Pam Berlin, starred legendary 7-time Emmy Award winning actor Ed Asner and 2-time Tony Award nominee Jayne Atkinson.
, to keep him from getting beaten up by the angry boyfriend of a girl Evan had been trying to be "just friends" with.
The cast also included Blair Baker and Donald Corren.
Evan also has a soft/blind spot where his father Eddie is concerned.
The reading, produced by Burke-Cohen Entertainment, was the flagship event of Remembrance Readings, a national program in honor of Holocaust Memorial Day presented by the National Jewish Theater Foundation.
When Eddie reappears in the brothers' lives, Evan, unlike Hank, wants to forgive and forget, for a long time refusing to see character flaws in Eddie which Hank and Boris have immediately spotted, which makes Boris' exposure of Eddie's criminal acts towards the end of Season 2 even worse.
During the week of February 21, 2017, "The Soap Myth" had 5 West Coast readings: @ Marin Academy and Marin Theater Company (San Francisco), @ Shomrei Torah Synagogue in West Hills (LA), University Synagogue in Irvine and at Center Theatre Group's Kirk Douglas Theatre in Culver City (LA).
However, Evan is still determined to maintain a relationship with Eddie, and the brothers stand by their father when he is sentenced.
The cast was Ed Asner, 4-time Tony Award nominee, 2-time Drama Desk Award winner and 2-time Emmy Award nominee Tovah Feldshuh, Blair Baker and Donald Corren under the direction of Pam Berlin.
In Season 8 after Eddie disappears without a word on the day of his marriage to Ms. Newberg, Evan is determined to finally break off any relationship with his father, and it is only through Hank's efforts that they are reconciled.
From January 22 to February 1, 2018, "The Soap Myth" enjoyed a brief tour starring Ed Asner as Holocaust survivor Milton Saltzman and two time Tony Award nominee Johanna Day in the dual roles of Holocaust scholar Esther Feinman and Holocaust denier Brenda Goodsen.
By the second season finale, he is finally in a serious relationship with Paige Collins and at Hank's urging has left with her for a trip to Europe.
Blair Baker again played Annie Blumberg and Ned Eisenberg played the roles that had previously been played by Donald Corren.
In the third season, he proposes to Paige and they are engaged, but his ambitions and plans to expand HankMed cause major friction between himself and Hank.
The play was again directed by Pam Berlin.
They get married with Eddie as the minister (his license from the internet) which turns out, in season 5, to not be legal in the Hamptons township bylaws.
The largely sold-out performances were at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts in Miami Beach, FL, the Adolph and Rose Levis Jewish Community Center in Boca Raton, FL, the Parker Playhouse in Fort Lauderdale, FL, the Zeiterion Theater Performing Arts Center in New Bedford, MA, Congregation Rodeph Shalom in Philadelphia, PA, The Museum of Jewish Heritage in Battery Park City, New York City, and Hofstra University in Hempstead, Long Island, NY.
In the sixth season, Hank offers them his spare room, but Paige and Evan rent a new home and insist that Emma stay with them.
"The Soap Myth" dramatizes the powerful confrontation between survivor memory and historical memory and depicts the insidiousness of Holocaust denial.
This causes tension, as they begin to feel very cramped in such a small space with three people.
More than a half century after World War II, at the desperate urging of a passionate survivor, a young investigative reporter finds herself caught between numerous versions of the same story and trying to separate fact from fiction.
Their landlord helps them realize mid-squabble that Paige and Evan tend to put others needs above their own and they "do this to ourselves."
Did the Nazis make soap from the corpses of their murdered Jewish victims?
In Season 7, Boris buys Hampton Heritage and appoints Evan as Interim Hospital Administrator.
Played out against the backdrop of deadline reporting and journalistic integrity, Jeff Cohen's critically acclaimed play The Soap Myth uses this horrific possibility as its catalyst.
In the series finale, when Boris leaves the Hamptons permanently, he gives Evan full tenancy of Shadow Pond.
It questions who deserves the right to write history — those who have lived it and remember, those studying and protecting it, or those seeking to distort its very existence?
He later has her formal title changed to Physician Associate, on the grounds that people only look at the "Assistant" part of the title.
And finally, what responsibility should others take once they know the truth?
She interviews to be Hank's physician assistant after word travels of Hank's instant reputation as a concierge doctor.
Although "The Soap Myth" is a work of fiction, it is, in the words of the program, "inspired by real people and real events as well as an article written by Josh Rolnick in "Moment" magazine profiling Holocaust survivor Morris Spitzer."
Initially brushed off by Hank (despite her truckload of medical equipment), she has gained the job by the second episode.
Foremost among the play's historical inspirations is the evidence that the Nazi regime had a program at the Danzig Anatomic Institute in 1944 to develop a process for the mass-production of soap from the fat of Jews being slaughtered in Nazi extermination camps, and produced soap in small quantities at a nearby concentration camp.
She is Indian and her family spends the summer in the Hamptons.
In a dramatic moment, the players re-enact testimony from the Nuremberg Trials, including this recipe:
Divya admits that she is practicing medicine without her parents' knowledge, stating that she is unhappy with the degree of control they try to exert over her, the most notorious example being forcing her to marry her childhood friend, an Indian man named Raj.
5 kilos of human fat are mixed with 10 liters of water and 500 or 1,000 grams of caustic soda.
In episode 5, "No Man Is An Island", Divya reveals to Jill that she has tried to start a concierge physician service twice before, but failed both times.
All this is boiled 2 or 3 hours and then cooled.
She later is forced to tell her parents about her career after Evan practically told them everything (under the belief that they already knew).
The soap floats to the surface while the water and other sediment remain at the bottom.
They accept the news, but still expect her to marry Raj and leave the Hamptons, letting her reveal that she hates the fact that her parents never consider any of her ideas.
A bit of salt and soda is added to this mixture.
It was revealed that she first wanted to get into medicine when she was a little girl and helped take care of a cut on her friend.
Then fresh water is added and the mixture again boiled 2 or 3 hours.
When she told her parents they did not listen and told her that she would get an MBA, marry Raj, and work at his business.
After having cooled, the soap is poured into molds."
In the last episode of the first season, she resolves to break off the engagement at the last minute.
The play's central character, is an elderly Holocaust survivor called Milton Saltzman, worked doggedly to establish as fact the idea that the Nazis produced and used soap made from human corpses, even handing bars of such soap to Jews on their way into the sealed chambers that functioned alternately as gas chambers and as shower rooms in the Nazi concentration camps.
She changes her mind, and becomes engaged to Raj.
The second character is a young journalist called Annie Blumberg assigned to write a story about Saltzman.
In the second season, she becomes increasingly wary of her wedding, culminating in her becoming infatuated with Adam, one of HankMed's patients.
She is soon caught between her sympathies for Saltzman and the adamant stand of a number of distinguished scholars of the Holocaust who refuse to publish the Nazi manufacture of soap as fact despite a large amount of eyewitness testimony, including the eyewitness testimony of both Nazis and British prisoners of war at the Nuremberg trial who worked in the experimental soap manufacturing facility at Danzig in 1944, because contemporary documentation is lacking.
In the season finale, after she and Raj are exposed to pneumonic plague, Divya decides to call off her wedding once and for all, as she felt the universe had sent her "one sign too many" that she could not ignore.
The scholars in the play fear that without proof beyond the eyewitness testimony, the story of the manufacture of soap from human bodies will become ammunition in the hands of Holocaust deniers.
In the 2011 season premiere, Divya broke the news to her parents that she and Raj had broken off their engagement.
Two characters representing historians of the Holocaust argue strongly that although a large number of eyewitnesses including former British POWs, Nazis, and Holocaust survivors have testified about the soap production, because no actual laboratory or production records survive as physical documents, any publication about the production of soap will be used by Holocaust deniers to discredit the reality of the Holocaust itself and, therefore, that no assertions that any soap production took place should be published.
Divya's mother tries to convince her to beg Raj to take her back.
A character called Brenda Goodsen, an amalgam of a number of Holocaust deniers including David Irving, appears in the play to demonstrate the evil of anti-Semitism in the form of Holocaust Denial.
She tells her parents that she refuses to go along with their wishes and wants to marry for love instead, which upsets her father.
This character delivers a speech for minimizing the Holocaust and concluding that the Jews brought it on themselves.
In the episode "But There's a Catch", all signs point to the fact that Divya has been financially cut off by her parents after refusing to go through with the marriage, as her credit (which was still in her father's name) was refused when buying supplies for HankMed, her car was repossessed, and Evan finds out that she has not cashed any of the checks paid to her through the practice.
Holocaust historian Robert Melvin Spector concludes that the Nazis "did indeed use human fat for the making of soap at Stutthof," albeit in limited quantity.
Hank and Evan allow Divya to stay with them until she gets back on her feet, even going so far as to buy her a car.
The material in the Nuremberg Trial scenes in the play use as dialogue actual testimony given by British prisoners of war and by Nazis at the historical trials about the development of an industrial process for producing soap from human bodies at the Danzig Anatomic Institute, the production of such soap on a small-scale basis at Stutthof concentration camp, and the actual use of this soap by Nazi personnel.
Divya eventually moves into a place of her own, only to discover that Raj's parents expect her personally to pay off the expenses they put into the engagement and wedding.
A film, directed by Ron Kopp and Mr. Mittelman, was made of the National Jewish Theater production.
Rather than sell her shares of HankMed to them, as they had intended, Divya takes a part-time shift at Hamptons Heritage to pay off the debt, but the mounting demands on her time juggling both jobs has serious consequences which cause her to resign of her own accord.
That film will be broadcast nationally through American Public Television on PBS stations across the country.
By the end of the third season, Evan comes up with a solution to her debt problem.
The sponsoring station, WPBT2 in Miami, will air the premiere broadcast on January 27, 2014.
In season 4, Divya and Rafa got married in Las Vegas but in the season finale of season 4, Divya says they need to end it, as she burns their license.
In addition, the film will be the first American offering on Britain's prestigious Digital Theatre website.
It is revealed in episode one of season five that Divya is pregnant with Rafa's baby.
Ron Kopp also directed "I Will Refuse to Bubble: History and Theater as Defiance," a documentary about the making of "The Soap Myth" that examines the question of who has the right to write history, highlighting the importance of theater in understanding the world's most incomprehensible events.
In "Bones to Pick" Divya falls in pain and is rushed to the hospital where she, Hank, Evan, and Paige discover that she has a sub-chorionic hemorrhage behind the placenta.
Featuring Holocaust survivor Irving Roth and scholars Michael Berenbaum, David Marwell and Bonnie Gurewitsch, it also is distributed online by Digital Theatre.
Jeremiah shows up at the hospital to see Divya after Evan calls him to talk to Divya.
John Kettlewell (10 March, 1653 – 12 April, 1695) was an English clergyman, nonjuror and devotional writer.
Everyone else leaves the room and Jeremiah admits his feelings to Divya.
He is now known for his arguments against William Sherlock, who had justified the change of monarch of 1688-9 and his own switch of sides in "The Case of the Allegiance".
When Divya is put on bedrest, Jeremiah offers to take care of her, since she lives with him.
According to J. P. Kenyon, Kettlewell's reply made a case "with which conformist Anglicans could only agree, because it was spiritual, while Sherlock's was resolutely aspiritual".
Divya worries that he may still be in love with her and she says she doesn't want to take advantage of him, but Jeremiah says that he's outgrown his original feelings for her but that he hasn't outgrown his friendship with her.
He went on to attack defenders of the Glorious Revolution generally as proponents of fallacious contractarian theories.
In season 6, Divya has a party for her newborn little girl and the "army of random Hampton notables" her father invited.
He was the second son of John Kettlewell, a merchant at Northallerton, Yorkshire, by his wife, Elizabeth Ogle, was born 10 March 1653, and was educated at Northallerton Grammar School under Thomas Smelt, a royalist, whose other pupils included George Hickes, William Palliser, Thomas Burnet, Thomas Rymer, and John Radcliffe.
In the season 7 finale, Divya and Raj attend the funeral rites of her grandmother.
Kettlewell matriculated at St Edmund Hall, Oxford on 11 November 1670, and graduated B.A. 20 June 1674.
Later, Raj and Divya admit that they love each another; he proposes to Divya and she accepts.
On Radcliffe's resignation of a fellowship at Lincoln College, Oxford, Kettlewell was elected in his place in July 1675, with the backing of George Hickes, then himself a Fellow.
She is also accepted at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and begins studying to become a full-fledged doctor.
For about five years he acted as tutor in college, and proceeded M.A. 3 May 1677.
In the closing epilogue scene, Evan discusses the HankMed schedule with Hank, disclosing that Divya is still a member of HankMed.
He was ordained deacon by John Fell in Christ Church Cathedral 10 June 1677, and priest 24 February 1678.
Boris Kuester von Jurgens-Ratenicz (Campbell Scott): A mysterious (seemingly) German nobleman with a large estate in the Hamptons (filmed at Long Island's Oheka Castle).
The reputation which his first book made for him led to his appointment as chaplain to Anne, Countess of Bedford, and to his presentation by Simon Digby, 4th Baron Digby to the vicarage of Coleshill, Warwickshire (December 1682).
In the series' pilot, Hank saves the life of April, a guest at Boris's party and Boris rewards Hank with a bar of solid gold, a job as concierge doctor, and use of his guest house.
He resigned his fellowship at Lincoln College on 22 November 1683, devoted himself to his parish, where he preached the high church doctrine of passive obedience.
He has apparently referred several of Hank's patients to him and admits to "having plans" for Hank.
In 1685 Kettlewell married.
Boris is extremely secretive, having moved to the Hamptons specifically to stay out of the public eye.
Through the Glorious Revolution he preached strongly against rebellion; he adhered consistently to this principle, and was deprived of his vicarage in 1690.
Boris sometimes uses his money to bend and break rules.
He moved to London, and spent the remainder of his life, occupied in the composition of devotional books and controversial tracts.
He owns a shark which was being used in a medical experiment and injures one of the scientists in one episode.
Shortly before his death he proposed to Bishop Thomas Ken the establishment of a fund for the relief of the suffering deprived clergy; and circulars asking for subscriptions were issued.
Hank states after a physical examination that Boris is in almost perfect physical health, yet Hank knows that something is wrong.
But the charitable scheme was regarded by the government as a seditious usurpation of authority, and prosecutions were instituted.
It is later discovered that Boris has a genetic disease that has affected, at least, the past three generations of his family.
Kettlewell died at his house in Gray's Inn Lane on 12 April 1695, at the age of 42.
The condition causes a lack of muscle control, degenerating brain function, and death around the age of 44.
He was buried on 15 April in the church of All Hallows Barking, in the same grave in which William Laud had been interred, and was commemorated in a Latin inscription on a marble tablet erected by his widow at the east end of the church.
Boris is somewhat cavalier about experimentation to cure his disease; this has led to unintended side effects such as muscle spasms and temporary blindness from not heeding Hank's advice.
At Kettlewell's funeral Ken officiated for the only time in public after his deprivation.
In season two, Boris agrees to let Hank "quarterback" a cooperative effort between all of Boris's former doctors and researchers.
Kettlewell had married at Whitchurch, near Reading, on 4 October 1685, Jane, daughter of Anthony Lybb of Hardwick House in the parish of Whitchurch; they had no children.
In "Medusa" they fly to Cuba to consult her; having diagnosed the condition, she allows for Boris to enter a clinical trial on the condition.
His papers were entrusted by his widow to Robert Nelson, who published some of them.
While Hank suggests further research to confirm its success and validity, Boris begins treatment the next day.
His first book, 'The Measures of Christian Obedience,' a summary of Christian morals as involved in obedience to the laws of the Gospel, was written between Christmas 1677 and Easter 1678, but was not published until 1681, when, at Hickes's suggestion, Kettlewell dedicated it to Henry Compton, bishop of London, but this dedication he suppressed after Compton had appeared in military array on behalf of the Prince of Orange.
During a code blue where Boris crashes and needs to reboot, which loses the data for the trial but keeps him alive.
His second publication resulted from his parochial work; he was in the habit of preaching preparation-sermons before communion, eight or nine times in the year, and of these he printed a summary in 1683 under the title of "An Help and Exhortation to Worthy Communicating", dedicating the book to Lord Digby.
He later decides to stay for an extended period to reconnect to Marisa, and he announces his news that Marisa will be defecting upon his return in "Whole Lotto Love".
Shortly after the suppression of Monmouth's rebellion he preached a sermon, in his collected works with the title of "Measures of Christian Subjection."
However, by the end episode it seems that she was arrested and detained, leaving a distressed, helpless Boris.
As a supplement to his first book, that on "Christian Obedience", he published in February 1687-8 his "Practical Believer", which passed through many editions.
At one point, Jill drops Boris's name in an attempt to prevent the hospital board's closing down her free clinic in an attempt to take it over; the stratagem works, but at the cost of losing Boris as a donor, as his privacy as an anonymous donor was violated.
Kettlewell's works are:
He is seen in the half-season finale flying out in a helicopter, despite his weakness, and retrieving Marisa from custody by unknown means.
A treatise on the new oaths was left by him in manuscript, but never printed.
Also as a precaution against Eddie, he begins an investigation into the Lawsons to determine their implicitness in Eddie's role as a confidential informant, using his aide Catherine (Rena Sofer) posing as a patient.
Studio Miraval is a recording studio in Correns in southern France, situated in the heart of the department of Var near the French Riviera.
His findings are revealed to the family, which resulted in Eddie's heart attack.
Many famous musicians have recorded there, including Rammstein, Sade, AC/DC, The Cure, and Shirley Bassey.
When it seems certain that Eddie will be convicted and sentenced to prison, he offers to have Eddie spirited out of the country and beyond extradition, but he makes it clear to Eddie that he is doing this for Hank and Evan's benefit because he believes that the brothers will be better off without Eddie in their lives.
It is a residential studio, much like Château d'Hérouville, with a chef-in-residence, three dwellings, and a swimming pool.
When he learns that Marisa is pregnant with his child and that Hank knew but did not tell him, he evicts Hank and Evan from his summer house.
The recording studio itself measures with a ceiling.
However, realizing his rashness and accepting the strength of Hank's ethics, he asks Hank to come back in season three and HankMed moves back into the summer house.
The control room measures .
Hank discovers that Boris was poisoned with thallium, which caused, among other things, muscle spasms.
The studio was created in 1977 by jazz pianist Jacques Loussier and sound engineer Patrice Quef.
The diagnosis was made on the basis of Boris's blood causing Hank's bare hand to tingle.
Loussier began by recording his own work, mainly for films, and then started taking on French clients such as Maxime Le Forestier and Pierre Vassiliu.
The poison was found in the swimming pool, and Dieter was nowhere to be found.
Miraval achieved fame thanks to Pink Floyd, who came there in 1979 to record part of their album "The Wall", the liner notes of which credit Miraval.
They discuss the possibility that Boris's family inheritance of illness may have been the result of "family politics."
Subsequently, equipped with one of the first SSL mixing consoles in France, Miraval recorded AC/DC, The Cure, Muse, Wham!
Things become more complicated when a member of Boris's family comes for a visit, bringing hopes of reconciliation.
, David Sylvian (solo and with Rain Tree Crow), Chris Rea, Sade, the Go-Betweens, Steve Winwood, Yes, UB40, Chris Braide, Shirley Bassey, the Gipsy Kings, Shakatak, Rammstein, Fonky Family, Kelly Family, Blankass, Silmarils, Jimmy Barnes and many others.
Boris is involved with Dimitri in a secret, multinational operation in Season 4.
In 1992, Loussier sold Miraval to an American buyer.
In the episode "Off-Season's Greetings", it is hinted that he faked his own death in an explosion at Shadow Pond.
The studio remained active, in particular for the recording of Jacques' trio's albums.
In one episode Boris mentions visiting his family in Klein-Walsertal, Austria.
Since 2003, when Courtney Love spent several weeks there, the studio has throttled back, and it has suffered from the declining record sales plaguing the music industry in the 2000s.
Paige Lawson (née Collins) (Brooke D'Orsay): An upper-class girl who pays Evan to pretend to be her boyfriend while she has a relationship with a much older man.
Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have been renting Miraval since the summer of 2008, which probably hinders commercial exploitation of the recording studio.
She is somewhat domineering, as is her father, who is a retired general.
Enoch Arden Mounts (July 9, 1917 – March 4, 2003) was an American NASCAR Grand National Series driver from Gilbert, Mingo County, West Virginia.
She is also naive, and believes that any problem can be solved by money.
His primary vehicle was the #18 self-owned Pontiac machine; although he would occasionally drive a Hudson vehicle on the race track.
She engages in many hobbies befitting her high social status including hunting, painting, golf, and surfing, and has a long list of connections she can call upon.
He raced in the NASCAR Grand National Series from 1953 to 1956.
Her first appearance, "Comfort's Overrated", was when her boyfriend Graham, a man in his 50s, was injured in a surfing accident.
Like J.D. McDuffie, Alan Kulwicki, and Joe Nemechek, Mounts was an "independent" race car driver who would never receive manufacturer's support or the support of blockbuster sponsors.
She attempts to hire Hank as a "faux-beau", a fake boyfriend to cover from her parents who are questioning her lack of evidence of having a boyfriend.
Arden would earn six finishes in the top ten from the 37 races that he would compete in NASCAR.
While Hank declines, Evan manages to convince her to hire him, which leads to a day of makeovers and photo shoots.
The 1954 Grand National season would see Mounts record his best championship finish at 21st place in the standings.
During this, Evan begins to fall in love with her, which Paige fails to or refuses to consider.
During his career, Mounts would earn $2,505 in race winnings ($ when adjusted for inflation) and race 4489 laps - the equivalent of .
Graham breaks up with her as he leaves for his African photo shoot, wishing that she did not feel the need to hide him from her parents.
Only the 1953 and 1956 NASCAR Cup Series seasons would see him finish better than he started in the races.
However, her "faux-beau" diversion was still in effect, and in "Frenemies" Evan is taken to meet her parents.
Mounts would end up losing nearly one position on average from start to finish during his entire career.
When her father blindsides them by taking them to a year-round hunting grounds, and Evan's inadequacy leads to him being (minorly) injured.
His appearance at the 1955 Southern 500, where he would crash into Don Duckworth's stalled vehicle, would be captured on highlight films for generations.
After realizing Evan's dedication to her, and hearing his heartfelt, unrehearsed speech on her own dedications, she decides to take him out for dinner.
While Bill Champion managed to avoid Duckworth by swerving past the vehicle rapidly, Arden Mounts managed to see the stalled vehicle too late and crashed into him in a very hard manner.
After some major ups and downs in their relationship, at the end of the second season she invites Evan to join her in a trip to Europe and at Hank's urging he agrees.
The proper usage of seat belts on the stock car automobiles would save the lives of both Mounts and Duckworth.
In the third season, Evan proposed to Paige.
The types of racing tracks that best favored Arden was the dirt tracks where he finished an average of 18th place; intermediate tracks were very much a disadvantage to Mounts, where a finish of 42nd place was the career average for him.
In the 4th season, Paige found out she was adopted.
Mounts would die while being a patient at St. Mary's Hospital, a medical center in Huntington, West Virginia.
At the season 4 finale, Paige and Evan got married.
Albert Augustine Ltd. is the originator of and currently a manufacturer of nylon classical guitar strings.
They get married with Eddie as the minister (his license from the internet) which turns out, in season 5, to not be legal in the Hamptons township bylaws.
In addition, the company supports the classical guitar and guitarists by presenting several annual New York guitar series at the Manhattan School of Music, the Queen Sofia Spanish Institute and other important venues, by commissioning hundreds of original solo and chamber music works and concertos from some of the foremost contemporary composers, by donating thousands of dollars for scholarships, special artist's projects and guitar festivals, and by publishing Guitar Review magazine.
In the fifth season, Paige is offered a job for a few months in Paris, just after Evan is elected into the township council.
In 1926-7, Albert Augustine (born Denmark 1900, died New York City, April, 1967) moved to the United States to pursue his career as a luthier.
Paige says she thinks they need distance from everything that is getting in the way of their marriage.
In 1928, he married his wife, Rose.
Evan finally acts like an adult and puts his and Paige's relationship above his own ambitions.
During this period, he experimented with different types of strings without significant result.
Paige says that Kristoff can go to Paris and she'll stay here with Evan but the first thing they need to do is to get legally married and go to marriage counseling (as Evan says at the same time that they should go on their honeymoon).
It was to be almost 20 years before his collaboration with famed guitarist Andrés Segovia would result in the development of the nylon guitar string.
They then agree that they should go on a honeymoon.
In the mid-1940s, Andrés Segovia mentioned the shortage of good guitar strings in the United States, particularly his favorite Pirastro catgut strings, to a number of foreign diplomats at a party, including General Lindeman of the British Embassy.
In the sixth season, Hank offers his spare room, but Paige and Evan rent a new home and insist that Emma stay with them.
A month later, the General presented Segovia with some nylon strings which he had obtained via some members of the DuPont family.
This causes tension, as they begin to feel very cramped in such a small space with three people.
Segovia found that although the strings produced a clear sound, they had a faint metallic timbre which he hoped could be eliminated.
Their landlord helps them realise mid-squabble, that Paige and Evan tend to put others needs above their own and they "do this to ourselves."
Nylon strings were first tried on stage by Olga Coelho in New York in January, 1944.
They tell Emma and she says she completely understands and agrees to move into Hank's spare room.
In 1946, Segovia and Augustine were introduced by their mutual friend Vladimir Bobri, editor of "Guitar Review".
One of the plotlines in the final two seasons is her and Evan's struggle to become pregnant, a goal made difficult because of Evan's low sperm count and motility, culminating in Season 8 in an In vitro fertilisation that, despite some premature false alarms to the negative from a home pregnancy kit, prove successful.
On the basis of Segovia's interest and Augustine's past experiments, they decided to pursue the development of nylon strings.
Dr. Jeremiah Sacani (Ben Shenkman) is one of the two physicians brought to HankMed by Evan after Hank temporarily resigns.
DuPont, skeptical of the idea, agreed to supply the nylon if Augustine would endeavor to develop and produce the actual strings.
He often is uncomfortable around people, preferring to distance himself to the point that he memorized his patients by Social Security Number rather than by name.
After three years of development, Augustine demonstrated a nylon first string whose quality impressed guitarists, including Segovia, in addition to DuPont.
He is shown to have a small amount of hero worship for Hank, whom he desperately wants to impress.
Wound strings, however, were more problematic.
He falls in love with Divya, very early on after he is hired, but she is unaware and it is so difficult to work with her while she's dating Rafa that he leaves to go on a research trip to Iceland.
Eventually, however, after experimenting with various types of metal and smoothing and polishing techniques, Augustine was also able to produce high quality nylon wound strings.
When Divya's house needs to go under construction to get rid of a toxic mold and to add a window to her walk-in closet for her new nursery, Jeremiah offers to share his home with Divya.
Augustine suffered a heart attack in 1948, but survived.
He, at first, finds it very difficult to share his personal space with her when she tries to add a little homey touch to the kitchen by adding a bouquet of flowers and a throw.
Segovia became a great supporter of Augustine's work.
It isn't until season 5's "Bones to Pick" that Jeremiah admits to Divya how much he cares for her and her friendship.
He commissioned a guitar from Augustine in 1956 which was never finished.
When Divya is put on bedrest, Jeremiah offers to take care of her, since she already still lives with him.
Augustine died of his second heart attack in 1967.
Divya worries that he may still be in love with her and she says she doesn't want to take advantage of him, but Jeremiah says that he's outgrown his original feelings for her but that he hasn't outgrown his friendship with her.
Under Rose Augustine and following her death in 2003, the company continues to produce nylon strings and support the field of classical guitar.
Also in the 5th season, Jeremiah officially resigns from HankMed after feeling like he was manipulated and used by Hank when Hank asked him for a prescription for pain medication after his head surgery.
South Africa national rugby union team players hold several international records.
Hank offers Jeremiah another option: that he can work at HankMed but never have to work with Hank because Jeremiah would be in charge, not Hank.
Several players from the South Africa national rugby union team have joined the IRB and International Hall of Fame.
In season 6, Jeremiah struggles with living with Divya and her new baby because the baby is so messy, chaotic, and keeps burping on him (he even goes so far as to go into his closet and yell into a pillow to let out his frustrations).
South Africa's "most capped player" is Victor Matfield with 120 caps.
After Hank gets back from being a helicopter doctor, he asks Jeremiah if he wants to continue being the HankMed Director, which Jeremiah says he does.
Matfield is the "most-capped lock for any nation" in rugby history, with all of his 120 appearances at that position.
Jeremiah begins frequenting a pub for lunch and seems to be building feelings for Viviana, the bartender at the pub.
The "most-capped back" is Percy Montgomery, whose 102 caps made him the country's leader until first being equalled by John Smit and later surpassed by Matfield, but was regained by Smit.
In the series finale epilogue, it is revealed that Jeremiah is still a member of HankMed.
Montgomery also holds the South African record for "Test points" with 893, which at the time of his international retirement placed him sixth on the all-time list of Test point scorers (he now stands ninth).
She is an executive-level administrator at Hamptons Heritage, the area hospital looked down upon by the elite (who have a running gag stating how it is a death trap or "taco stand"), because it had saved her arm after a teenage surfing accident.
Steyn also holds the Springbok record for the "fastest 100 points" (8 Test matches)
Hank and Jill meet in the first season opener while leaving Boris's party and again when Hank is dealing with "New Parts" Newberg; at the end of the episode, Jill and Hank's love and career interests blossom at a clam shack.
Although statistics on the success rate of kicks at goal were not kept until the late 1980s, it is believed that Steyn also holds the record for "most consecutive successful kicks at goal in Tests".
For the first three episodes Jill drives a well-aged Saab 900 Turbo convertible essentially identical to Hank's car, but replaces it with a new Toyota Prius after her Saab "dies".
He had a streak of 41 successful kicks at goal, which started during the Boks' Test against Italy on 19 June 2010 and ended on 6 November 2010 against Ireland.
She describes Hank as "cute", as she says in episode 2 while she is drunk, and again at the end of the episode, when not drunk.
John Smit was the "world's most-capped captain", having has captained South Africa in 82 of his 110 Tests.
She is often worried that her relationship with Hank will turn out like her other relationships, all of which were disasters.
He has since been overtaken by Richie McCaw and Brian O'Driscoll.
In episode 7 she reveals that she gave her ex-husband (Charlie) an ultimatum, either her or his job, he chose his job and left her.
The "world's most-capped lock pairing" is that of Victor Matfield and Bakkies Botha, who have started together in 62 Tests.
It is later revealed she is still legally married to Charlie, because with all his travels she could never locate him to give him the papers to sign.
Smit also played 46 "consecutive matches" for South Africa, which is a record.
In the last episode of the first season, she was going to tell Hank she wanted to be with him, she sees him with another girl (his patient for the episode) and gets the wrong idea.
The record "try scorer" is Bryan Habana with 67 international tries.
She later kicks Charlie out of her house at the end of the first season.
Fly-half Jannie de Beer holds the "world record for dropped goals in a Test match" (5, during the 44–21 quarter-final win over England in the 1999 Rugby World Cup)
She left the show to organize hospitals in Africa, thus fulfilling her dream of helping the poor.
The "most points" Montgomery ever scored in a "single international" was 35 against Namibia in 2007—this is also a South African record.
In Season 8 in the series' 100th episode "Doubt of Africa", she returns to the Hamptons for a visit.
On 1 August during the 2009 Tri Nations tournament, Morné Steyn set a number of records during the second Test between the Springboks and the All Blacks.
In the series finale, Hank leaves the Hamptons to travel to Africa to see her, and their relationship is rekindled.
The Springboks won 31–19, with Steyn scoring all South Africa's points – 1 try, 1 conversion, 8 penalties.
In the episode epilogue, it is revealed that she and Hank are now married and still working in Africa (although they will be spending the summer in the Hamptons working at HankMed and spending time with their whole family).
Eleven former South African international players have been inducted into either the International Rugby Hall of Fame or the IRB Hall of Fame.
She has a podcast and believes in schmoozing her patients much more than Hank does.
Six are members of the International Rugby Hall of Fame only; two are members of the IRB Hall of Fame only, and four are members of both Halls of Fame.
She is hired by Boris as a substitute for Hank during his (extended) stay in Cuba, and Divya has trouble putting up with her.
Barry "Fairy" Heatlie, who played in the late 19th century and into the early 20th, was one of the early greats of South African rugby.
She later moves to the Hamptons, claiming that the Hamptons are big enough for the both of them, leading to conflict when she attempts to secure her own position through aggressive marketing.
He appeared for Western Province 34 times between 1890 and 1904, with 28 of them being Currie Cup wins.
She eventually leaves to San Diego during "Big Whoop" to deal with family.
He also played six Tests for South Africa against the Lions in 1891, 1896, and 1903, and also captained the side to their only two Test wins of the 1890s.
She is more cautious socially, legally and pragmatically, as she refuses to react to calls for a doctor unless she can be sure it would not legally endanger her.
Arguably his greatest legacy to South African rugby is the green jersey; he is credited with introducing the colour for South Africa's 1903 Test against the Lions at Newlands.
Her attitude to medicine leads to many conflicts; rather than using the most medically sound practice, she would rather use a more well-received treatment to keep her patients liking her.
He was inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame in 2009.
Nevertheless, her perfectionism leads to hold all in high standards, including herself; any clinical error she makes she finds distressing.
Bennie Osler played 17 consecutive Tests between 1924 and 1933.
She and Hank carry on a relationship for portions of the second season, but the relationship ends when Emily is either unwilling or unable to share of herself with Hank as much as he hoped.
Playing at fly-half, his first Test was against the touring British team in 1924.
Tucker Bryant is the teenage great-grandson of the inventor (Marshall David Bryant II) of the blender (in reality, the blender was invented by Stephen J. Poplawski) and Libby is his girlfriend.
He also played in the series against the All Blacks in 1928, but most notably captained the Springboks on their Grand Slam tour of 1931–32 when they defeated all four Home Nations.
Tucker and Libby were injured when Tucker crashed his father's Ferrari F430.
His last Tests were the five played against Australia when they toured to South Africa in 1933.
Libby's injuries are mild, but she proves to be a cyberchondriac and thanks to the Internet is prone to bouts of medical babbling.
Osler was inducted to the International Rugby Hall of Fame in 2007 and the IRB Hall of Fame in 2009.
She is also a health nut, prompting Tucker to state, "she has food so fresh you can taste the dirt"; Tucker describes Libby as "a handful" but quickly adds "but the best usually are."
Making his Test debut in Olser's Grand Slam winning team in 1931 was scrum-half Danie Craven.
Hank discovers that Tucker, who was more severely wounded, is a hemophiliac, which complicates his injuries.
Craven played several positions including fly-half, scrum-half, centre and even number-eight.
Hank performs a "MacGyver"-like procedure to stabilize him (such procedures are pretty commonplace in the series).
However Craven was most famous for popularising the dive pass.
Hank later befriends the young couple, despite a stern rebuke from Tucker's wealthy father, Marshall David Bryant IV.
As well as winning a Grand Slam with Osler's team, Craven toured with 1937 Springboks to New Zealand where they achieved their first series victory over New Zealand.
The elder Bryant, however, is rarely home, which causes Hank to become a surrogate father to Tucker.
His last act as player was captaining South Africa in a Test series against the Lions.
The couple is almost broken up by Evan's bad advice to Tucker on trust in male/female relationships, but ultimately remain together.
Craven's involvement with the Springboks continued after his playing retirement, and he coached them to a 4–0 series win over the touring All Blacks in 1949.
Later in season two, in the episode "In Vino Veritas", it is revealed that Tucker's father is a substance abuser (after a severe withdrawal overseen by Hank, Tucker takes his father to a rehab center in New Canaan, Connecticut) and that Tucker's grandfather has "cut off" Tucker's father.
He was elected President of the South African Rugby Board in 1956, a position he held until the post-apartheid South African Rugby Union was formed in 1991.
In season three, in the episode "An Apple A Day", Hank must treat Libby's divorced, bisexual mother Elyse (Julie Benz), who has trouble healing from an injury due to scurvy.
Craven was instrumental in the formation of the South African Rugby Union and became its first Executive President.
At some time between seasons 4 and 8, revealed in the series finale episode "Uninterrupted," Tucker and Libby split up permanently and Libby, her cyberchondria now totally controlled, becomes involved in humanitarian causes.
Such was Craven's influence in South African rugby he became known as "Mr Rugby", was inducted into the International Hall of Fame in 1997, and was in the second class of inductees into the IRB Hall of Fame in 2007; behind Rugby School and William Webb Ellis.
He is rarely home, leaving Tucker to fend for himself.
The man most credited with inventing modern number 8 play was Hennie Muller, inducted into the International Hall of Fame in 2001.
He is also domineering, and does not like it when Hank or Tucker stand up to him.
He played 13 Tests between 1949 and 1953, and in the process won a 4–0 series victory over the All Blacks and a Grand Slam tour of Britain and Ireland.
In one episode, he is revealed to have a substance abuse problem.
He was nicknamed "Windhond" (greyhound) for his speed around the field.
Marshall attempts to use a rapid detoxification program, which almost kills him, yet he continues to use drugs.
When writing about the 1949 series against the All Blacks, Harding and Williams wrote: "(Okey) Geffin won the series, perhaps, but Muller made it possible."
Tucker responds by telling his father that what he wants for his birthday present is for his father to get clean, and he is last seen being driven by Tucker to a detox center.
Of Muller's 13 Tests, he only lost one—against Australia in 1953.
In the second season it is revealed that he has been cut off from his money by his father and all the money has been left to Tucker.
Named South Africa's player of the 20th Century in 2000, Frik du Preez played 38 Tests between 1961 and 1971.
He is portrayed as a pompous jerk unable to take no for an answer, yet seemingly liked among the higher staff, where Jill once stated, "through any disaster he has come out of clean, leaving me to clean up the mess".
Du Preez could play both flanker or lock and was one of the most dominant forwards of the 1960s, but was especially well known for his all round skills.
When things do not work out with Jill, she gives him an ultimatum to choose between her and his job, and he chooses his job.
Danie Craven said of du Preez, "To my mind he could have played any position on a rugby field with equal brilliance."
When Jill attempts to file for divorce, Charlie flees the country to invalidate it, though when he returns, he hints that he might let the divorce go through, yet he repeatedly postpones signing it to try to woo her.
He was inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame in 1997 and the IRB Hall of Fame in 2009.
He is alluded to in several episodes, most of the times being brought up by Jill when Hank does something that reminds her of Charlie and makes her believe she is making the same mistake again.
Morne du Plessis played 22 Tests for South Africa between 1971 and 1980.
Charlie eventually makes an appearance halfway through the first season, when he confronts Jill and gets brambles removed by Hank.
His debut was at Number 8 in South Africa's series win over Australia in 1971.
He also gets his old job back at Hamptons Heritage.
He went on to captain South Africa and became part of the only father-son pair to captain South Africa—his father had captained South Africa in 1949.
He is trying to win Jill back, which complicates things with Jill and Hank and hinders their relationship for a while.
He led South Africa to a 3–1 series win over the All Blacks in 1976 and a series win over the British and Irish Lions in 1980 by the same margin.
In the first season finale, she kicks Charlie out of her house after he lies to her.
Du Plessis would be inducted into the International Hall of Fame in 1999.
It is also revealed he quit from Hamptons Heritage and moved away.
International Hall of Fame inductees Naas Botha, inducted in 2005, and Danie Gerber, inducted in 2007, both had careers interrupted by South Africa's sporting isolation in the 1980s and early 1990s.
Dr. Elizabeth Blair (Marcia Gay Harden): A surgeon and board member at Hamptons Heritage Hospital who is a mentor-turned-adversary to Jill.
Botha made his Test debut against the South American Jaguars in 1980.
After the resignation of Charlie, Blair believes Jill is a liability to the hospital.
Playing at fly-half, Botha played 28 Tests and scored 312 Test points before his international retirement in 1992.
She becomes one of Hank's clients when her son develops carbon monoxide poisoning from an improperly vented hot tub.
Botha contributed significantly to the Springboks 1980 series win over the Lions, and also played for the World XV in the IRB Centenary Match at Twickenham.
In the second season, she often tries to interfere with Jill's free clinic proposal, although she claims it is because of the board's decision.
Gerber also made his debut in 1980, and scored 19 tries in his 24 Tests before retiring in 1992.
Raj Bandyopadhyay (Rupak Ginn): Divya's fiancee from an arranged marriage at the beginning of the series.
He scored a hat-trick against England in 1984, and played alongside Botha in the World XV team in 1986.
Divya broke off the engagement at the end of season 2 partly for the need for independence and partly because she felt she and Raj were not fated for one another.
In South Africa's first Test since the fall of apartheid, against the All Blacks in 1992, he scored twice.
They reconnected in season 7 after each had a failed marriage and children and were finally married.
Two players that straddled the amateur and professional eras were Francois Pienaar and Joost van der Westhuizen.
Ms. "New Parts" Newberg (Christine Ebersole): A middle-aged woman who is always having cosmetic surgery that turns out badly.
Both first played for the Springboks in 1993.
In the first episode, when one of her saline implants fails, Hank empties her other implant to make both breasts even.
Pienaar was named captain in his first Test against France, and went on to captain the side to the 1995 World Cup.
In the third episode, Evan signs her to a summer-long retainer for a large amount of money.
It was there he captained South Africa to the World Cup title, and received the trophy from Nelson Mandela who was wearing his number 6 jersey.
However, she cares deeply for anyone who works for her, referring to them as family, even using her retainer to have Hank take care of her maid.
Nelson Mandela later wrote "It was under Francois Pienaar's inspiring leadership that rugby became the pride of the entire country.
She is also obsessed with her dog Koufax, and throws a "bark mitzvah" for him.
Francois brought the nation together."
She has been married at least three times to a lawyer, a doctor and a banker.
Pienaar entered the International Hall of Fame in 2005, and was inducted into the IRB Hall in 2011 alongside all other World Cup-winning captains from the inaugural event in 1987 through 2007 (minus the previously inducted Australian John Eales).
She has a stepdaughter named Blake and at least one granddaughter.
Joost van der Westhuizen also participated in the 1995 World cup victory, but went on to play in two more World Cups.
In season two, it is revealed that she has begun a relationship with Eddie Lawson.
Playing at scrum-half, van der Westhuizen played 89 Tests for South Africa and scored 38 tries.
Although Hank and Evan are skeptical, it seems that the relationship has a positive effect on Eddie, though Newberg sometimes assumes the persona of an overbearing stepmother.
At the time of his retirement following the 2003 World Cup he was South Africa's leading try scorer and most capped player.
In between seasons two and three, Ms. Newberg allowed Hank and Evan to stay at her mansion and operate their business after they were evicted from Boris' summer house (she resides in Manhattan outside the summer).
He entered the International Hall of Fame two years after Pienaar, in 2007.
He is discussed extensively in season one.
The newest Springbok player to enter the IRB Hall is John Smit, inducted in 2011 alongside Pienaar.
During Hank's adolescence and Evan's childhood, he walked out on the family when their mother was dying.
The captain of the 2007 World Cup winners, Smit (as noted earlier) ended his international career as the most-capped Springbok in history.
Evan has been able to reconcile himself with his father's legacy, but Hank has pointedly not.
The 2009 Silver Helmet (BK) is the 2009 version of Bronze Helmet organized by the Polish Motor Union (PZM).
At the end of season one, Evan lends all of HankMed's capital to Eddie, which almost bankrupts HankMed and leads to a rift between Hank and Evan.
The Final took place on 11 September in Wrocław and was won by Maciej Janowski (Atlas Wrocław).
He makes his first on-screen appearance in the season two opener, when he returns some of Hank and Evan's money, to which Hank responds by punching him in the face.
Janowski beat Patryk Dudek (Falubaz Zielona Góra) and Łukasz Sówka (KM Lazur Ostrów Wlkp.)
By the next episode, he has returned all of the money and has begun a relationship with "New Parts" Newberg.
Heat 21: Adamczewski (Gate A), Curyło (B)
Though Hank asks Eddie to leave The Hamptons (as he is causing him too much trouble), he decides to stay.
Gonville & Caius College (often referred to simply as Caius ) is a constituent college of the University of Cambridge in Cambridge, England.
He attempts to be a good father to his children, but often misses the mark.
The college is the fourth-oldest college at the University of Cambridge and one of the wealthiest.
He attempts to pull some sort of con on Boris, which later turns out to be spying on him for the Securities and Exchange Commission in return for a reduced fraud sentence.
The college has been attended by many students who have gone on to significant accomplishment, including fourteen Nobel Prize winners, the second-most of any Oxbridge college (after Trinity College, Cambridge).
It is a devastating blow to him when he is actually convicted and sentenced to prison.
The college has long historical associations with medical teaching, especially due to its alumni physicians: John Caius (who gave the college the caduceus in its insignia) and William Harvey.
He accepts Boris' offer of escape but in a last-minute change of heart agrees to stay and serve his sentence.
Other famous alumni in the sciences include Francis Crick (joint discoverer, along with James Watson, of the structure of DNA), James Chadwick (discoverer of the neutron) and Howard Florey (developer of penicillin).
In season three, he is conditionally released on a special work program, one of the conditions of which is the wearing of an ankle bracelet and night-time confinement at his sponsor's house–the sponsor in question being his estranged father (Ed Asner).
Stephen Hawking, previously Cambridge's Lucasian Chair of Mathematics Emeritus, was a fellow of the college until his death in 2018.
After his successful parole hearing, he decides to remain temporarily in Florida to repair his relationship with his father.
The college also maintains reputable academic programmes in many other disciplines, including law, economics, English literature and history.
In Season 8, Eddie announces his engagement to Ms. Newberg to Hank and Evan, but disappears on the day of the wedding.
Gonville & Caius is said to own or have rights to much of the land in Cambridge.
Hank eventually tracks him down (to the Lawson family's old home in Passaic, New Jersey), and Eddie explains that fear and serious medical problems caused his flight.
Several streets in the city, such as Harvey Road, Glisson Road and Gresham Road, are named after alumni of the College.
While Hank understands, Evan is not so forgiving and Eddie's relationship with him is nearly destroyed.
The college and its masters have been influential in the development of the university, founding other colleges like Trinity Hall and Darwin College and providing land on the Sidgwick Site, e.g. for the Squire Law Library.
In the penultimate episode "The Good News Is ...", Hank manages to reconcile them, and Eddie and Ms. Newberg are successfully married and leave for their honeymoon.
The college was first founded, as "Gonville Hall", by Edmund Gonville, Rector of Terrington St Clement in Norfolk in 1348, making it the fourth-oldest surviving college.
Dr. Marissa Casseras (Paola Turbay): A Cuban doctor who is one of the leading experimenters on Boris's condition.
When Gonville died three years later, he left a struggling institution with almost no money.
She advocates a risky procedure for Boris that involves a bone marrow extraction, of which Hank disapproves.
The executor of his will, William Bateman, Bishop of Norwich, stepped in, transferring the college to its current location.
She and Boris are somewhat amorous, and it is her love for Boris that drives her.
He leased himself the land close to the river to set up his own college, Trinity Hall, and renamed Gonville Hall "The Hall of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary".
When attempting to flee Cuba for the United States, she is arrested.
Bateman appointed as the first Master of the new college his former chaplain John Colton, later Archbishop of Armagh.
Boris later brings her to the Hamptons, where Hank finds out she is pregnant and that she does not want Boris to know because of his determination that his genetic condition will not be passed on.
By the sixteenth century, the college had fallen into disrepair, and in 1557 it was refounded by Royal Charter as "Gonville & Caius College" by the physician John Caius.
Boris is angered when he learns about the pregnancy and that Hank kept the knowledge from him; however, his attitude changes and they have a son, with Hank becoming the child's godfather.
John Caius was master of the college from 1559 until shortly before his death in 1573.
After kissing him, she immediately confessed to Hank, promising she would never see him again.
He provided the college with significant funds and greatly extended the buildings.
However, she later returned to treat him, angering Hank.
During his time as Master, Caius accepted no payment but insisted on several unusual rules.
Though Adam still wanted to date Divya, she said she could not, as she was engaged to Raj.
He insisted that the college admit no scholar who “is deformed, dumb, blind, lame, maimed, mutilated, a Welshman, or suffering from any grave or contagious illness, or an invalid, that is sick in a serious measure”.
The heavily conflicting desires of Divya and the resultant emotional confusion resulted in Adam leaving to film another documentary at the end of "A History of Violins".
Caius also built a three-sided court, Caius Court, “lest the air from being confined within a narrow space should become foul”.
Jack O'Malley (Tom Cavanagh) is a professional golfer first seen paired with Jill Casey at a golf fundraiser in Season 2.
Caius did, however, found the college as a strong centre for the study of medicine, a tradition that it aims to keep to this day.
He had been a promising young golfer, but had choked during a tournament on the 18th tee.
By 1630, the college had expanded greatly, having around 25 fellows and 150 students, but numbers fell over the next century, only returning to the 1630 level in the early nineteenth century.
He is first diagnosed by Hank of having a disorder of the hand causing the curvature of his fingers, and is successfully treated.
Since then the college has grown considerably and now has one of the largest undergraduate populations in the university.
Jack returns in Season 3 in order to get a physical from Hank, but discovers that he has Lupus.
The college first admitted women as fellows and students in 1979.
He attempts to delay treatment and later passes away.
It now has over 110 Fellows, over 700 students and about 200 staff.
Eddie did not know that Emma existed, but later finds out from a PI investigation that Emma ran away from her mother and has been lying to everyone about her childhood.
Gonville & Caius is one of the wealthiest of all Cambridge colleges with net assets of £180 million in 2014.
Eddie, Hank, Evan, and Paige invite Emma to stay with them for the summer.
The college’s present Master, the 43rd, is Pippa Rogerson.
Evan admits to Paige that he paid ("bribe" in Paige's words) Emma to hang out with Eddie and to help her pay for her apartment because it's so expensive "I was trying to be a good brother."
The first buildings to be erected on the college’s current site date from 1353 when Bateman built Gonville Court.
He says that he just wanted Emma to have a chance to get to know Eddie.
The college chapel was added in 1393 with the Old Hall (used until recently as a library) and Master’s Lodge following in the next half century.
At the end of season 6, episode 4: "A Bridge Not Quite Far Enough," Evan says to Paige, "is she staying because of us or because of the money?"
Most of the stone used to build the college came from Ramsey Abbey near Ramsey, Cambridgeshire.
After moving in with Paige and Evan, they eventually ask her to move out because they're too crowded in their new place.
Gonville and Caius has the oldest purpose-built college chapel in either Oxford or Cambridge which has been in continuous use as such.
In "Goodwill Stunting" Emma sells a picture of a celebrity to a gossip magazine and continues to do so in "Electric Youth"
The chapel is situated centrally within the college, reflecting the college's religious foundation.
He has appeared in several episodes with his employer, Boris, but has almost no dialogue.
On the re-foundation by Caius, the college was expanded and updated.
He does a variety of tasks, including assembling dossiers on people with whom Boris associates.
In 1565 the building of Caius Court began, and Caius planted an avenue of trees in what is now known as Tree Court.
He was the one responsible for Boris' near-death poisoning in the first half of Season Three, and in the penultimate episode of Season Three it is revealed he was arrested in Germany.
He was also responsible for the building of the college's three gates, symbolising the path of academic life.
He has been replaced since by a similar character named Udo.
On matriculation, one arrives at the Gate of Humility (near the Porters' Lodge).
Dr. Harper Kubelick (Kat Foster) is a young pediatrician whom Hank dated early in Season 4.
In the centre of the college one passes through the Gate of Virtue regularly.
They break up when Hank chooses to stay with a patient "just in case" there was something wrong with her (she was fine) instead of going to Harper's family reunion.
And finally, graduating students pass through the Gate of Honour on their way to the neighbouring Senate House to receive their degrees.
When Hank called, Harper said, "She must be happy you were there to support her" to which Hank ritually replies, "Yeah".
The Gate of Honour, at the south side of Caius Court, though the most direct way from the Old Courts to the College Library ("Cockerell Building"), is only used for special occasions such as graduation.
Initially, Divya is afraid that Viviana is using Jeremiah, but she realizes that Jeremiah and Viviana both like each other.
The students of Gonville and Caius commonly refer to the fourth gate in the college, between Tree Court and Gonville Court, which also gives access to some lavatories, as the Gate of Necessity.
Viviana eventually leaves the Hamptons to pursue a degree in Tulsa, resulting in a tearful goodbye in front of the local courthouse.
The buildings of Gonville Court were given classical facades in the 1750s, and the Old Library and the Hall were designed by Anthony Salvin in 1854.
Ray Mazzarino (Jeremy Davidson) is a business man who recently moved to the Hamptons in season 6.
On the wall of the Hall hangs a college flag which in 1912 was flown at the South Pole by Cambridge's Edward Adrian Wilson during the famous Terra Nova Expedition of 1910–1913.
He enlists the help of Paige to help redesign his house to impress his significant other.
Gonville Court, though remodelled in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, is the oldest part of the college.
He also becomes involved in the lives of Evan and Hank, for Hank he is a patient and for Evan he is his partner.
New lecture rooms were designed by Alfred Waterhouse and completed by Rattee and Kett in 1884.
Ray helps Evan create Hank Lab which is used instead of the hospital.
Tree Court is the largest of the Old Courts.
In common with other contemporary submarines, they feature air-independent propulsion.
It is so named because John Caius planted an avenue of trees there.
The first was planned to enter service in 2015, and the second in 2016, but "weight imbalance problems" delayed the project for 7 years.
Although none of the original trees survive, the court retains a number of trees and the tree-lined avenue, which is unusual for a Cambridge front court.
The lead ship in the class, the Isaac Peral (S-81), is under construction, and is expected to be delivered by December 2022.
Caius owns a substantial amount of land between West Road and Sidgwick Avenue.
The S-80 class has also been offered for export.
Set in landscaped gardens, the modern Harvey Court (named after William Harvey and designed by Leslie Martin) was built on the West Road site in 1961.
The S-80's AIP (air independent propulsion) system is based on a bioethanol-processor (provided by Hynergreen from Abengoa) consisting of a reaction chamber and several intermediate Coprox reactors, that will transform the BioEtOH into high purity hydrogen.
Adjacent to Harvey Court is the Stephen Hawking Building, which opened its doors to first-year undergraduates in October 2006.
The output feeds a series of fuel cells from UTC Power company.
Providing ensuite accommodation for 75 students and eight fellows, as well as providing conference facilities in the vacations, the Stephen Hawking Building boasts some of the highest-standard student accommodation in Cambridge.
The Reformator is fed with bioethanol as fuel, and oxygen (stored as a liquid in a high pressure cryogenic tank), generating hydrogen and carbon dioxide as subproducts.
Additional buildings provide housing for older students, a day care, and various study and music rooms.
The produced hydrogen and more oxygen is fed to the fuel cells.
The college also owns extensive gardens and the land on which the adjacent Squire Law Library has stood since 1995.
The bioethanol-processor also produces a stream of highly concentrated carbon dioxide and other trace gases that are not burned completely during combustion.
Caius also has one of the largest libraries in Oxbridge, housed in the Cockerell Building.
This gas flow is mixed with sea water in one or more ejector venturi scrubbers and then through a new system called SECO (or CO Removal System), developed by Bionet, and whose purpose is to dissolve the "bubbles" of CO in water to undetectable levels.
Caius acquired the lease on the building, which previously housed the Seeley History Library and the Squire Law Library, in the 1990s.
The oxygen and fuel flow rates are directly determined by the demand for power.
The college library was relocated there from Gonville Court in the summer of 1996, following an extensive renovation.
A permanent-magnet electric motor moves a fixed propeller of a special design, that doesn't create cavitations at high speed.
These courts are across Trinity Street on land surrounding St Michael's Church.
In the 1980s France began studies for the replacement of their S-60 "Daphné"-class diesel submarines.
St Michael's Court was completed only in the 1930s, with the building on its south side of a new building overlooking the Market Place.
The French shipyard DCNI came up with an all-new design called S-80, with a teardrop hull and new weapons and sensors, which their government decided not to fund.
The college also owns several houses around Cambridge, on Mortimer Road and Gresham Road, where some second year undergraduates live, and on Harvey Road and St Paul's Road, which are occupied by graduate students.
DCNI then proposed a cheaper option called the S-90B, an S-70 "Agosta"-class submarine with limited improvements which was again rejected by the French but which was exported to Pakistan.
The Fellows' garden lies just beyond Harvey Court, on Sidgwick Avenue.
Meanwhile, Spain faced the same problem in replacing their "Daphné"s, known as the "Delfín" class in Spanish service, as part of Plan ALTAMAR.
The extensive sports fields are located on Barton Road, a few minute's walk from Harvey Court.
Bazán (later Izar, and then Navantia) started on a new design but when it started to look like the S-80, it was agreed to collaborate in a joint venture based on the French S-80.
Caius Boat Club is the college's boat club, with the men's 1st VIII remaining unbeaten in the seasons of 2010/11 and of 2011/2012.
This joint design was shown at Le Bourget Navale in October 1990.
Caius Jazz takes place most terms in the college bar, inviting 'some of the most illustrious names in the contemporary scene' and a house band of students studying at London conservatoires to play in the college bar.
The end of the Cold War meant that funding dried up and the joint venture had to wait until 1997 for their first sale - to Chile - of the new design, which was designated the in export markets.
In recent years Steve Fishwick, Sam Mayne, Ian Shaw, Barry Green, Gareth Lockrane, and Paul Jarvis have all been featured.
The same year Spain started to look again at its requirements, and in 1998 they indicated that they would buy four Scorpènes, optionally with an air-independent propulsion (AIP) system for greater endurance when submerged.
The Caius May Ball is an all-night party in June, held every two years.
A staff requirement for the S-80 Scorpène variant was completed in October 2001.
The choir was founded by the composer Charles Wood in the late nineteenth century, and is currently directed by the scholar of South-American choral music, Geoffrey Webber.
This was soon overtaken by events, as the Armada (navy) became more interested in using submarines for power projection than in a more static, defensive role.
The choir tours abroad and records eclectically.
This shift was codified in guidance of January 2002 from the Chief of Naval Operations and in the strategic defence review of February 2003.
The choir is made up from Scholars and Exhibitioners from the college, and a few volunteers from other colleges.
The new requirement called for a larger submarine with better endurance and land-attack missiles, which became known as the S-80A design.
"You All Dat " is a song recorded by the Bahamian group, Baha Men.
This was an AIP submarine with a hull diameter of compared to for the Scorpène family, a submerged displacement of around 2,400 tonnes versus 1,740 tonnes, larger rudder surfaces and a different fin position.
It featured guest vocals from American vocalist Imani Coppola.
The Spanish government approved the purchase of four S-80A submarines in September 2003 and signed a contract with Izar on 24 March 2004.
Originally on 2 Zero 0-0, It was released in January 2001 as the second and final single from their album, "Who Let the Dogs Out".
The original deal was €1,756m to design and build four submarines, about €439m per boat, but by 2010 this had increased to €2,212m (€553m/boat).
It reached the top 10 in Australia and reached the top 20 in the United Kingdom.
The plan envisaged the first boat to be delivered in 2011 but government dithering over who should supply the combat system pushed it back to 2013.
The song, which samples "The Lion Sleeps Tonight", is about a man trying to seduce a woman at a party.
In 2011 Spain's budget crisis further delayed the first delivery until 2015, with the remaining boats being delivered at one year intervals until 2018.
A "clean" edit changes the line "You gotta have balls or you ain't gonna get none" to "You gotta be bold or you ain't gonna get none."
Construction of S-81 began on 13 December 2007.
The song was featured in season 2, episode 15 ("The Grandparents") of "Malcolm in the Middle".
In January 2012 the names were announced, honouring three engineers who made submarines and the first commander of Spain's submarine force respectively - Isaac Peral (S-81), Narciso Monturiol (S-82), Cosme García (S-83) and Mateo García de los Reyes (S-84).
It was also included on the show's soundtrack, "Music from Malcolm in the Middle", released in 2000.
In May 2013, Navantia announced that a serious weight imbalance design flaw had been identified which will delay the delivery of the first submarine to the Spanish Navy until possibly 2017.
The Oracle of the Lamb is an ancient Egyptian prophetic text written on a papyrus in Demotic Egyptian and dated to the thirty-third year of the reign of the Roman Emperor Augustus (r. 27 BC – 14 AD).
Excess weight of 75 - 100 tons has been added to the sub during construction and the current design is not able to resurface after diving.
In it, a lamb speaks and provides prophecies to a man named Pasenhor.
A former Spanish official says the problem can be traced to a miscalculation — someone apparently put a decimal point in the wrong place or by the addition of new technologic devices.
The lamb describes a world turned upside-down and reduced to chaos: temples are in disarray, the ruler has now become the ruled, and the Medes (i.e. referring to the Persian domination of Egypt) have come to destroy Egypt.
Lengthening the submarine would create additional buoyancy, though at a cost of €7.5m per metre.
It also mentions that the Greeks (i.e. referring to the Ptolemaic domination of Egypt) will take the White Crown (representing pharaonic Upper Egypt).
With the project also suffering with an underperforming AIP system (which was to allow the submarine to stay underway for 28 days but was only managing 21 days) the Spanish Defence Ministry announced in June 2013 that Navantia has signed on the US company General Dynamics Electric Boat to help solve the excess weight.
The story is comparable in style, tone, and subject matter to prophetic texts of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt, such as the "Prophecy of Neferti".
In September 2014, the detected overweight was reported to have been resolved and the construction work to be ready to resume in late October 2014.
Gozzoli, Roberto B. (2006).
In November 2014, Navantia again reported having completed the redesign work to address the problem of overweight.

, the intended delivery date of the first submarine is September 2022.
Diop Kamau (born Don Jackson, March 16, 1958) is an American civil rights activist who investigates and works to resolve instances of police misconduct, neglect, or abuse.
In January 2017, it was reported that the AIP system would not be ready in time for the delivery of the first submarine.
In 1994 he founded policeabuse.com, and is also its CEO.
The Indian Navy considered the S-80 for its next generation of submarines under Project 75I.
Don Jackson is an African American civil rights activist and investigative journalist who has pioneered groundbreaking investigations into two of the nation's most pernicious dimensions of policing: bias-based profiling and the widespread refusal by the police to properly document serious allegations of abuse and egregious misconduct.
The Kammel originates west of Mindelheim, in the district Unterallgäu, and flows generally north.
Jackson was born on March 16, 1958, at BonAir hospital in South Central Los Angeles.
It flows into the Mindel (left tributary) south of "Offingen at the Danube", east of Günzburg in the district Günzburg.
He is the fourth child of Margie Faye Woods, a nurse, and Woodrow Jackson, one of the first African Americans to join the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Office.
Municipalities which are passed by the Kammel are (from south to north):
Woodrow and Margie raised Don along with his five siblings in a neighborhood of manicured lawns and middle-class homes in Compton, California.
in the district Unterallgäu: Stetten, Kammlach, Oberrieden, Pfaffenhausen and Breitenbrunn;
Don remembers his father rushing out of their home in the midst of the Watts rebllion in 1965 to join other police officers attempting to control the violence.
The name of the Kammel derives from the Celtic "kamb" or "camb" which means crooked.
Jackson grew up in an environment where hard work was rewarded, and education was encouraged.
Other authors are of the opinion that Kammel means bog.
He attended Birmingham high school where he excelled in sports, serving as captain of both his high school football and wrestling team.
It is found from southern Wyoming to Durango, Mexico.
He went on to California Lutheran College on an athletic scholarship, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice.
Born in London, the son of John Wilcoxon Rooth, barrister-at-law (1835–1874), and Elizabeth Cody (1825–1917), daughter of Henry Smith of Bristol.
After college Jackson joined the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office.
He was born in January 1869 and baptised 20 January at St Paul's Church, Camden Square.
His time there was punctuated by tests of his character and physical stamina.
He was educated at Highgate School and University College University of Oxford where he read history (BA 1890).
Despite the Ventura County police academy’s record of washing out black recruits, Jackson graduated from the academy and later transferred to the Hawthorne Police Department where he would hone his skills as an elite undercover investigator.
He was best known as the doctor in charge of the delivery of future vaudevillian and film actors Violet and Daisy Hilton, conjoined twins born in Brighton in 1908 and the first to live to adulthood.
Jackson rose through the ranks quickly at Hawthorne as he sponsored several daring undercover operations.
He provided a medical testimony of them for the "British Medical Journal" in 1911.
Jackson was taught by his parents that when you are African American you must often be twice as good as your competitors.
He died in Hove, Sussex, in 1963.
With that in mind, he earned the top score on three consecutive promotional exams to become the youngest sergeant on the force.
Urbanspoon was a restaurant information and recommendation service founded in 2006 by former Jobster employees that offered its services in North America and parts of English-speaking Australasia and Europe.
But as his career flourished, Jackson became frustrated with the routine brutality and frequent racism displayed amongst his peers.
In January 2015, Zomato, an India-based restaurant search and discovery service, acquired Urbanspoon.
Jackson rebelled against his brothers in blue, first by filing complaints about misconduct directed against minority citizens, and later by going public with a complaint of racism at the Hawthorne Police Department.
The Urbanspoon website and Seattle business operation initially evolved with addition of content team workers for door-to-door data collection of restaurant information, an operational design that had served Zomato well in India.
As Jackson’s battle with the Hawthorne PD spilled into the media, his father Woodrow Jackson, who was near retirement, was stopped by a group of Pomona California police officers.
However, Zomato discontinued the Urbanspoon website on June 1, 2015, redirecting Urbanspoon traffic to Zomato servers; at the same time, Urbanspoon's logo was incorporated into a new Zomato logo.
The officers identified the elder Jackson as a potential robbery suspect.
Zomato ceased earlier Urbanspoon app development, leading to departure of all Seattle engineers by August 2015.
He was taken from his car and brutally attacked.
Mid-October 2015, multiple U.S. Zomato (previously Urbanspoon) offices were closed, including the former corporate headquarters in Seattle.
A midnight phone call between Jackson and his dad would change the course of Jackson’s life: After learning of the brutality his father suffered, Don decided to take on the police in a one-man war against abusive cops.
Business reports as of October 2015 indicate either that Zomato-Urbanspoon has ceased all U.S. operations, or that it will retain a couple of sites, including Dallas, the new site of Zomato's U.S. administrative functions.
Jackson was a pioneer in the early development of hidden camera testing and the recording of public officials.
Urbanspoon was a restaurant information and recommendation service that operated in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, and in the United Kingdom and Ireland.
He used cutting edge computer technology to document police misconduct in 5000 investigations in over 100 cities, often accompanied by a rotating list of volunteers and undercover investigators willing to put their lives on the line to test the police.
It offered services via its website and standard apps for mobile operating systems.
News organizations became aware of Jackson’s efforts and often went in-tow.
In its evolution from an initial and popular iPhone application, UrbanSpoon adapted its appearance and capabilities, including to the Android market.
Jackson’s most well-known such investigation was the 1989 test of the Long Beach, California Police Department.
In these and other efforts to develop the product, the results were apps that were aware and competitive with alternative businesses Yelp and Where.
While testing profiling among officers for a news broadcast, Jackson was beaten, thrown into a plate glass window, and arrested.
Via its apps and webpage, Urbanspoon offered a restaurant search utility, with filtering by price, type of food, neighborhood, nearby businesses (movie theaters, sports venues, etc.), and special features (gluten-free fare, child-friendliness, BYOB-service, etc.).
As is often the case in hundreds of similar incidents, the officers falsified their arrest report.
Users could then participate in the simple "like" or "don’t like" rating system to review restaurants, and share restaurant information with friends via email, Facebook, Google+, Twitter, and Pinterest, and by photo pages.
However, unlike the many hundreds of police-citizen interactions which are not filmed, this one was captured on video.
Users who create an account could track dining experiences (menu items, price of meal, and photos), and could create a "Wishlist" to save restaurants for future use and a "Guide" to share personal lists of dining favorites.
The video recording of Jackson’s arrest exploded on national television and resonated in a way that other stories about police misconduct failed to.
In addition, the Urbanspoon app featured a "Slot Machine," allowing users to "Spin" (or shake their device) to randomly see a new eating establishment based on neighborhood, cuisine, or price.
The videotaped arrest and the obviously false police report of the incident gave police critics a formidable weapon.
The Urbanspoon website evolved in response to the Zomato acquisition, adding content based on the work of new team workers doing door-to-door data collection of restaurant information (menus, hours, etc.), an operational design that had served Zomato well in India.
Congresswoman Maxine Waters, along with others, rallied to Jackson’s support and called for hearings and investigations.
Zomato discontinued operation of the Urbanspoon website on June 1, 2015 (redirecting Urbanspoon search traffic to Zomato website servers), and rolled out a new Zomato logo that incorporated the earlier logo of Urbanspoon; hence, as of this date, Urbanspoon services ceased to exist.
In 1992, the California State Assembly held hearings and Jackson was called to testify.
Urbanspoon was acquired from its former Jobster employees Ethan Lowry, Adam Doppelt, and Patrick O’Donnell by American media and internet business InterActiveCorp (IAC) in April 2009.
The hearings resulted in a new law, which increased penalties for false reports to a felony and added requirements for all officers in the state of California to receive racial sensitivity training.
It launched RezBook in 2011, an online reservation booking service for restaurants.
(Ca.
OpenTable purchased the RezBook venture and capabilities from Urbanspoon for an undisclosed sum in 2013.
Penal code 118.1).
Urbanspoon was then acquired in an all-cash deal by Zomato, an Indian restaurant search and discovery service, in January 2015.
Though a new law had been passed, Jackson was not satisfied.
Its location has been based since its inception in Seattle, Washington, where the company was founded.
Jackson’s one-man war on the cops would change in 1991 when he met the love of his life, actress Tyra Ferrell, at a Hollywood party.
Urbanspoon offered Zomato an annual user base estimated to be approximately 31 million in early 2015 based on app downloads, and a directory of >1 million restaurants; Zomato's intention, based on information from its CEO, Deepinder Goyal, as reported by John Cook of "GeekWire," is to give the company "a nice footprint" as it expands in preparation to "battle industry heavyweight Yelp."
Ferrell was hanging out with friends at a house party when she and Jackson shared a glance.
Goyal is reported to have said: "'The biggest challenge and most fun part of this move, however, is the fight we’re going to be picking with Yelp, … [i]n the market they have dominated for so long.
It was love at first sight and the two would become inseparable a year later when they married.
After all, like Mark Twain famously said, it isn’t the size of the dog in the fight, it’s the size of the fight in the dog."
The marriage ceremony was consecrated on the deathbed of Jackson’s mother Margie who was in the final stages of breast cancer.
Zomato reportedly will integrate the Urbanspoon app and Web site over the next few months [of early 2015], "meaning the Urbanspoon brand will be phased out."
Her final joy was watching her son take his vows of marriage with a woman she adored.
Goyal has further stated, as reported by "The Seattle Times," that a result of the acquisition will likely be a downsizing of Urbanspoon in Seattle (by ≈10% of its employees), and "phase out its popular restaurant-finding app."
If anyone thought the marriage would slow down Jackson’s work, it had just the opposite effect.
Goyal has acknowledged that Urbanspoon was a valuable brand and that Zomato would lose brand equity in the short-term, but that uniformity of product was an aim, and that "to manage two brands within the same company" would be "harder for us [Zomato] in the longer term."
Ferrell, an A-list African American actress who had just completed the trailblazing film Boyz in the Hood, joined Jackson to support his cause.
On June 1, 2015 Zomato discontinued the Urbanspoon website, redirecting Urbanspoon traffic to Zomato website servers; at the same time, a new Zomato logo incorporated the earlier logo of Urbanspoon.
They left Southern California together in 1992, driving and camping out on a Goldwing motorcycle for their honeymoon.
These visible changes came alongside Zomato's business decision to cease app development, which led 12 engineers (two-third of its Seattle engineering workforce at time of acquisition) to leave between January and August 2015; the remaining engineers were laid off on August 6.
With Ferrell’s support, Jackson purchased the most sophisticated recording equipment available and went on a tear across the country producing eight Emmy and Edward R Morrow award-winning investigations into police misconduct and racial profiling.
Further extensive cuts in the U.S. workforce were made in mid-October 2015, with the closing of multiple U.S. Zomato (previously Urbanspoon) offices, including the former corporate headquarters in Seattle.
The investigations forced policy changes, police firings, and thousands of hours of retraining for officers stemming from the high-profile exposes Jackson produced with local and national media.
This layoff of the remainder of what was a workforce of 150 in the U.S., at San Francisco, Chicago, Denver, Dallas, Philadelphia, and New York offices, led former employees to report that the company has ceased all U.S. operations, with a Zomato source refining the report to say that some workers will be retained at a couple of sites, including Dallas, the new site of Zomato's U.S. administrative functions.
Jackson traveled the country with his wife, daughter, and a 40-foot RV hauled by a Ford F350 pick-up truck loaded with hi-tech investigative equipment.
A Successful Man  is a 1985 Cuban drama film directed by Humberto Solás.
As Jackson hit the streets, Tyra Ferrell stood by his side guiding his investigations.
It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival and it was entered into the 15th Moscow International Film Festival.
Many times, Ferrell was up all-night waiting by the phone to make sure Jackson got home safe.
It won Best Production Design and Grand Coral - First Prize in the 1986 Havana Film Festival.
In 1994, Jackson and Ferrell started Policeabuse.com to provide a safe place for citizens to report complaints.
The film was selected as the Cuban entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 60th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.
Over 25 years, the website has processed more than 20,000 complaints for citizens free of charge.
Ricky Lundell is a Gracie (Brazilian) Jiu Jitsu 3rd degree black belt under Pedro Sauer and considered by many to be his most technical black belt.
Through the website Ferrell and Jackson have pioneered hundreds of investigations resulting in prosecutions of police officers, policy changes, and settlements for indigent victims.
Ricky started jiu-jitsu at age six and is credited with being the youngest North American to receive the rank of black belt in Gracie (Brazilian) Jiu-Jitsu (age 19 when received).
Today their work stands alone as the only national hidden camera testing of police complaint intake procedures and racial profiling ever done.
He was the smallest person to win the absolute division of Pancrase by over 20 lbs and submitted Brandon Ruiz who is a 2x FILA Silver Medalist in the heavyweight division (265 lbs) who was on 2 USA World Teams with Ricky.
Their work is a 600 video YouTube archive of investigations on behalf of police misconduct victims.Many police agencies have made policy changes as a direct result of Jackson’s hidden camera investigations.
Ricky Lundell won the World Team Trials and took home MOG (Most Outstanding Grappler) award in 2007 and 2008.
Jackson and Ferrell’s videotapes and training materials have been utilized to educate both officers and citizens alike.
He represented the USA for Grappling 2x and is a 2x FILA World Championship in Submission Grappling under FILA (International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles), the same organization that oversees Olympic wrestling.
In 1994, as a political statement, Jackson changed his name to Diop Kamau (Quiet Soldier) to acknowledge his daughter’s birth.
Ricky started College at Utah Valley University when he was 15 years old and graduated with a science degree at 18.
24 years later Jackson returned to his birth name Don Jackson, as a tribute to his father Woodrow Jackson, the best cop he had ever known .
He was recruited by Cody and Cael Sanderson as a college senior to wrestle for Iowa State University at the age of 20.
He is married to the actress Tyra Ferrell.
He is the 1st D1 Wrestler to ever be recruited having only jiu-jitsu/submission grappling experience and no folkstyle match experience.
He was born in Los Angeles, California.
Despite the NCAA's refusal to give Ricky any eligibility to start for the team at ISU, Ricky lettered in wrestling and went on to win the USA World Team Trials where he won the Most Outstanding Grappler award and won the FILA Grappling World Championship while on the Cyclones team.
Beyond Reach is the sixth novel in the Grant County series by Karin Slaughter, originally published in 2007 .
Ricky holds notable wins over several world champions including Nicolas Renier, Tom Lecuyer, Brandon Ruiz, Alberto Crane and Jeff Glover, both in no-gi submission grappling tournaments.

Alston was also, the son of the colonial-era counterfeiter, Philip Alston, associated with Cave-in-Rock, Illinois, and Natchez, Mississippi.
The books feature characters Sara Linton, Jeffrey Tolliver, and Lena Adams.
Peter Alston was born the son of the notorious counterfeiter.
In this book, a main character of the series is impacted in a serious way, which resulted in much controversy and commentary on the event -- including spoilers being posted in online book review venues.
When and where he was born and where he grew up is not known, as there is scant information on his childhood and pre-criminal activities.
Slaughter has written a note to her readers about her decision, which is posted on her website.
He may have been born in South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Natchez, West Florida, now Natchez, Mississippi, Fort Nashborough, Virginia, now Nashville, Tennessee, or Russellville, Virginia, now Russellville, Kentucky.
The Heartsdale Children's Clinic is closed.
Having been the son of an outlaw, Peter Alston probably moved wherever his father hastily moved their family, remaining as far away from the pursuit of the law.
Sara spends all day being deposed in a malpractice lawsuit filed by the parents of Jimmy Powell, now dead from leukemia, and a deep-pockets-picking lawyer, over a ridiculous technicality.
According to Alex C. Finley, in "The History of Russellville and Logan County, Ky", Peter Alston used the alias "James May", as Wiley Little Harpe had used the name "John Setton", as his alias.
Everything she's built up for the last 16 years is crumbling away as greedy townspeople line up to get in on the action, not realizing their betrayal of her is only going to result in higher healthcare costs for everyone or that the nearest pediatrician is 100 miles away.
The earliest recorded use of the Peter Alston alias, James May, dated back to around 1797 or 1798, in Red Banks, Kentucky, now Henderson, Henderson County, Kentucky, where Alston appeared, with a woman, who claimed to be his lame sister, which could have been, one of his two sisters, Francis or Elizabeth.
Sara's parents are gone on a cross-country RV trip and her sister is counseling the homeless in Atlanta, only old/new husband Jeffrey is there for support.
While at the Red Banks, Alston stole horses, but was caught in Vincennes, Northwest territory, now Vincennes, Indiana, and brought back for trial.
When he's called away to the town of Reese, it's almost a relief to get to go with him...except that they're going because Lena lies in a hospital with smoke inhalation, under arrest and suspected of being involved in murder.
Peter Alson was never tried, as he broke out of jail the first night he was incarcerated.
She was found beaten badly, watching a torched SUV burn with a body inside it, on the 50-yard line of the high school football field, foot propped on an empty gas can.
Peter Alston later shifted his operations down river to Stack Island, on the lower Mississippi River, along with Samuel Mason, the notorious outlaw gang leader, after regulators cleaned the frontier criminal element out of western Kentucky and Cave-in-Rock, Northwest territory, now Cave-in-Rock, Illinois, in the summer of 1799.
And she won't say a word to anyone.
There Alston reunited with his father, Philip, and cast counterfeit silver coins, as well as taking part in Mason's river piracy operations.
Reese is Lena's home town, and she came back to check on her Uncle Hank, the ex-addict who raised her and her twin sister.
Mason was captured in 1803, and was transported overland from New Orleans towards the Mississippi Territory for trial.
She found him mixed up with some very unsavory characters and hooked on drugs again after being clean for three decades.
He escaped "en route", sustaining a gunshot wound in the process, and may have made his way back to his former gang.
And major events from her past are now in question, events that shaped who she is.
Mississippi territoreial Governor William C. C. Claiborne posted a $2,200 reward for Mason's recapture, which Alston and Harpe attempted to claim under the assumed names of "James May" and "John Setton."
One of the few things of which she is certain is that Jeffrey and Sara are in terrible danger, and she must stop at nothing to get them out of town.
In so doing they presented Mason's severed head as proof that he was no longer at large.
Vazhapadi Ramamurthy (died 27 October 2002) was an Indian politician from Tamil Nadu.
